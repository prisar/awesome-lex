something happened where they forced my hand it's the only time
that the soviet agent was anywhere near me on the territory of the united states
so i'm waiting for the a train on a dark morning still in queens and
there's this uh man in a black trench coat comes up to me from my right
and he whispers into my ears you gotta come back or else you're dead
the following is a conversation with jack barsky a former kgb spy author of deep undercover and the subject of an
excellent podcast series called the agent there are very few people who have
defected from the kgb and live to tell the story it is one of the most powerful
intelligence organizations in history and this conversation gives a window into its operation both from an
ideological and psychological perspectives but also it tells the story of a man who
lived one heck of an incredible life this is the lex friedman podcast to
support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's jack
barski let's start with a big basic question what is the kgb committee
right so that is the committee of uh state security yeah there's an apostrophe
threat okay and bs means this without right and i guess that directly translates to
security without threat so and don't don't exist anymore it was
disbanded when the soviet union fell apart and the successor agencies were are now the
svr and and the fsb fsb supposedly the equivalent to the fbi
and svr the cia but the svr is is relatively weak
and the fsb has has taken on a lot of espionage and you know active measures and they're much bigger
and stronger but the most capable intelligence agency in russia is the is the gru military intelligence
then nobody knows very much that's right i when i was in the kgb i had no idea that there was military intelligence
nobody ever mentioned anything like that and by the way i recently had a
the pleasure to give a talk at the dia when they reached out to me i didn't know they existed either interesting
yeah that's always the question if you want to be an intelligence agency should the world know anything about you
because in some sense you want to create the legend in order to attract
uh great competent individuals to work for you but at the same time
you want it to be shrouded in complete mystery if nobody knows you exist you might be able to operate
well as an intelligence agency that that is fascinating but fsb is the thing that
carries the flag right of of kgb kgb being
probably one of if not the most sort of infamous famous infamous and
powerful intelligence agencies in history yes ever absolutely 100
it was founded in 1954 after the death of stalin you've uh in writing your book
looked back at the predecessors of the history right is there some way in which
the kgb is grounded in um
the culture the spirit the soul of its predecessors oh absolutely they
just changed names and they changed uh personnel rather frequently and that had had something to
do with uh stalin's paranoia from between 1923 and i don't remember what
i think it may have been the nkvd at that time it started as a chika and then it became the
the gepe gpu the three or four letters yes
but with those name changes you also had changes at the top between 1923 and 1953 when stalin died
that is uh 30 years they had eight heads of uh intelligence
and of of those eight six were executed when they were replaced so that's an um
that's an indication that uh you know this was an organization that ate itself
from the inside the soviet union was the only dictatorship in history that did not rest its powers on the military they
rested its powers on the intelligence apparatus and that thing was unstable
so you know where that leads eventually if you rest your power on something that is made out
of bricks that don't hold a lot of load it will it will fall apart on sand yeah why was it unstable would
you say what what of human nature or what does that mean it's the paranoia it's a you know stalin
was always worried about uh you know what the the most powerful
people coming after him so he proactively killed off heads of the kgb and uh and he had this great
purge where he got rid of a lot of his generals you know really capable generals
uh and uh that that cost him dearly when world war ii started because you know he
he started off with uh with a uh a force that wasn't as capable
as it could have been uh was it paranoid at all levels i believe so i believe so
it it comes from the top and so if the top doesn't trust you uh you always have to worry about
um your peers snitching on you yeah okay so so and and i think
we have a very similar situation in russia today uh and uh and and in this in in this
kind of atmosphere um the truth will never get to the top so no matter
what moral rules the organization operates under trust is fundamental to
its uh competence oh absolutely and i want to extend this to my own existence
um and this is kind of strange it's it's almost dichotomous uh
because you know i was running around lying to everybody and you know i couldn't fundamentally be
trusted but the relationship that i had with the kgb was based on trust if they
don't if they don't trust me they don't send me out and if i don't trust him i'm not going
and i eventually broke that trust and they knew there was always that danger
they knew that because something about you or just something about human beings no
there were there were hints about uh you know how long
my assignment would be so 10 to 12 years and you see it makes sense all right i was becoming
an american and over time i would become more and more american and there was
always a chance that i liked it more here than there that that i was really
successful in what i was supposed to do and it sort of happened but in my case
it happened because of i fathered a child who who i didn't want to leave when they wanted me back so love always screws up
oh your employment competence yes you're absolutely right
yes so that but they thought you know that i had an anchor at home because i had a
wife and a son at home which uh you know you've got to worry about them if you defect
uh because in the past the kgb was would go after after family
ruthlessly including perhaps violence yeah this is a hard question about the kgb because
it's one of the most ruthless organizations but in general are there lines
kgb agents at every level of the hierarchy uh
that they would not cross political legal ethical or does anything goes to achieve the
goal i was only uh in touch with the two types of agents as
well the technical experts the ones that taught me tradecraft
and they were like engineers and uh you know they were in charge of the secret writing and the uh
uh the morse code shortwave radio and reception uh decryption encryption
and that kind of stuff um those were just doing their job all right
and the others the ones that trained me that uh prepared me for life in the united
states they were nice people they were elegant people
i i i don't think they that they would not uh um
fit into the stereotype of the ruthless gun carrying agent
is it possible that you would not be aware of the parts of the kgb
i mean it's very modular would you yeah it's possible that you're not aware the parts of the kgb that that are the
quote-unquote muscle oh i didn't know i would find out afterwards after i you know retired and
then started doing some research i had no clue you're kind of operating in a bubble oh we very much so i mean this is
what the kgb did really really well compartmentalization uh and and that
was based on you know the communist movement while it was still underground
you know the the cells were very small and the so that maybe there were three four members in one cell that knew one
another and then they had a liaison to another cell so with the bottom line is if if you got one one
of those folks were caught they could maybe betray four people or three something like that and in the kgb
continued with that tradition uh i have reason to believe that the my
handler the person in moscow that sort of directed me and made decisions uh
what to do and where to go never met me personally there's no reason to right why wouldn't
so uh and and this this uh actually uh was a big advantage uh over other
intelligence services because you know you look at what the cia does everybody blabs
there's a lot of leaks coming out of american intelligence i don't think there's as many leaks coming out of the
mossad strong words from jack barsky so i mean that is a question i want to ask a little more systematically is
there something unique about the kgb compared to the other intelligence agencies let's let's talk
uh british intelligence mi6 mossad cia is there unique cultures spirits souls
of the different organizations that maybe somehow connect to the structures of government connect maybe the
the values of the people those kinds of things i believe we were all pretty much uh
strong uh believers in communism in the future of the world being in kgb yes i
think that that unified us uh to a large degree even the technicians so even
it wasn't something like yeah yeah the the parents believe this thing
but we know the truth you really believe the story of conor absolutely did and it and you need to look at the time frame
uh the soviet union uh after world war ii made uh quite a bit of progress in uh uh
influencing the third world and i still remember uh in when i was in middle school
we had a map on the map of the world and it was color-coded so red was communism that was the soviet
union and then the the eastern states and then blue was uh capitalism and then
then we had green which were the third world countries and the green slowly turned pink because a lot of
third world governments like i'm looking at uh angola i'm i'm looking at uh um
vietnam a lot of these countries uh were uh very sympathetic to to uh the soviet union
and so we sort of knew that this would go on like that and eventually we would take over
and and you know pretty much uh uh overtake that was that that was the the myth
overtake the united states not only militarily but also in terms of industrial production and
and so forth that was a stupid pipe dream the military
it was a standoff as we know well uh stupid pipe dream
um hitler had a stupid pipe dream yeah that he executed
it exceptionally effectively and on if not for uh
a handful of military mistakes the world could look very different the biggest
one being invading the soviet union particularly at the time that he did it because he ran into
the same thing that napoleon ran into general winter well
within so operation barbarossa within that he could have made different
decisions yeah for example uh attacking
skipping kiev and attacking moscow directly overthrowing the government so marching i guess that that would be
learning the lessons from napoleon as opposed to um as opposed to a different kind of
distribution of forces and then getting bogged down in the winter but the point is
these ambitions sometimes do you know the ambitions of empire sometimes do materialize in the growth
and the building and the establishment of those empires and those empires write the history books
in such a way that we don't think of them as as empires or we certainly don't think of them as the bad guys
they write the history books therefore they're the good guys and right now america has effectively written the book
about the good guys i happen to believe that book but it's we should be humbled and
open-minded to realize that uh that is in fact what is happening is effective empires
write the history books and tell us stories and tell us propaganda and tell us narratives that we believe because we
are human beings and we love to get together and believe ideas we love to dream of a beautiful world and try to
build that beautiful world together in the united states that's a beautiful world the freedom
of respect of human rights of all men are created equal yes
pursuit of happiness you know it always sounds good if you look at what the the dream of communism
is it sure as heck uh in its words on the surface sounds good respect for the workers yes the
working class the lower classes that have been trodden on that have been stolen from by the powerful they deserve
to have the money the power the respect that they have earned through their hard work sounds great and everybody gets
along and we just have to you know uh and all men are
wonderful people and if they if they go bad it has something to do with the fact that they have they have been oppressed
right and uh that dream just never worked out and even even it is when you think about
it and i didn't think about it when you're young you know you just emotionally you
accept it but when you think about it somehow that new wonderful organization has to
organize itself even though lenin predicted that the state eventually would go away
how does how does that work then you have like anarchy right you have to have an organization and the only way to really
organize a large number of people is with a hierarchy so and who gets to the top
the the ones that are that want to go to the top the ones that believe in themselves the ones the ones that know
better than everybody else and once you have that hierarchy established there is no guarantee that
it doesn't that that it won't go bad and actually when you look at history every such hierarchy has gone bad you
know you look at cuba for instance i believe fido castro was a an honest revolutionary
i do believe that and so what did cuba turn into
yeah there's something about when you speak about vladimir putin in this way but let's step away from that for a
second is there something about being an honest revolutionary that wants to do good for
their country and you start to believe that you know better than everyone else how to do good on the country
and you very well might first but then somehow that grows into uh
a distortion field where you know you keep believing you know what's right and all the people who disagree with you
you stop seeing them as having a point you instead see them as like uh
um evil manipulators of the truth that are actually trying to hurt people for
their own greed for their own power and you will protect the people because you know what's good in the case of stalin i
i mean i don't know but it seems like he really believed that communism would
bring about a much better world i mean there is a sense
the you have to crack a few eggs to make an omelet right this idea that um
sacrifice is necessary to bring about a greater world and then the other aspect is
um sort of ruling by terror creating terrorism justified
political mechanism to achieve a better world so it wasn't i mean perhaps he had
to do that to be able to sleep at night with the atrocities he's committing he i think he believed he will bring about
another world and by the way the tarot didn't start with stalin it started right after the bolsheviks took over
when uh lenin uh told uh mr jaczynski commodore
trezinski to build the chicago and then uh execute
the this is what he called it the red terror so
so at that at the birth of the soviet union there was already terror and it was deliberate and it uh
it also was it wasn't just focused on the enemies it was focused on whoever
you didn't like there was there was no rule of law there was no uh there were there was no no court
cases you know people were just pulled out of their apartments and shot on site
yeah and the this was done by
con revolutionaries who were convinced that eventually you know that these sacrifices had to be made and eventually
that would lead to a much better planet and the populists believe this too that those sacrifices in part yes
this is such a dark thing about dictatorships is you
believe it but you're also too afraid to question
your beliefs like you're not directly afraid but almost like um
i don't know what that is that's almost like a subconscious fear like don't there's a dark room with the
locked door don't look in that door don't check that door and there's something about the united states that
says uh especially modern culture so go to that door first and sort of question
everything kind of uh that's the power of the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press but you can
get um almost become too critical and too cynical of your own culture in that way so there's a balance of strike of course
but man is if that's if communism is not a lesson of human nature i don't know what it is but you believed
without thinking too much about it you believe right in the story of khan what did you see just
you know i came from the soviet union what did you maybe feel
that's right and good about communism about the vision of communism do you remember like
i think the biggest impetus and me believing in communism was that
com the communists when when just before hitler took over
the communists were the only force in germany that fought the nazis
in the streets and that's a historic truth yes and and
communists were hunted down by the nazis killed uh put in concentration camps
and so what we knew when what we were taught and i think
that was a huge unforced era by the western countries particularly the united states that there were ex-nazis
in the government in west germany yeah and the most famous one was uh
reinhard galen who was in charge was the general in charge of uh
uh the intelligence on the eastern front under hitler
and when the the allied won the war
it was decided that galen was too important uh with his knowledge of the his and his organization was too
important to uh to not use so he was co-opted by the cia
and eventually wound up being the head of the bundesliga the cia of west germany
that gave us us when i say us you know the east german party a huge propaganda victory
i wanted to because his um the emotional aspect of this was as follows
when we uh we were in uh uh juniors in high school
uh and uh and though in those days uh when you you were only allowed to go to high
school if you were in the top 10 of students okay so this was going to be the next set of ruling elite in the country
we were sent we were required to visit a concentration camp
and if you know what what we as as 17 year
olds were made to look at it was gut wrenching how can men do something like that to
men piles of corpses
lamp shades made out of human skin because they that skin had tattoos on them and a
shrunken head so heads like the size of my fist and i mean the girls all cried
and it would have made a huge impression and that was the that was the nazis yeah and then yes the
communists i mean the united states course you know in in hindsight
if the communists had come to power it would have been just the other way around as we know uh given the example of stalin and mao
right so but we didn't know that right from the russian soviet
perspective uh the communist regime banded together
to win the the great patriotic war and that was the the second one you know the big
brother the the soviet union uh i mean when when i was approached by the kgb that was like oh i felt so
honored so we should say um
that we're talking about east germany that you're from east germany can you describe you were born
four years and what is it yeah four years ten days yeah sort of very good
after uh unconditional surrender in world war ii
so what is east germany what is west germany what is east and west germany
what is that what's the difference what's this the historical context here what is world war ii again and then
let's do for uh we don't have to go to uh world war one which uh the result of
which actually ceded world war ii in some respects yes um there's a long history yes uh but let's start with
world war ii so uh uh when hitler came to power he he and
his uh his uh leadership decided that uh uh the germans needed more what they
call laban's rom that means room to live so uh and they would you know they would
start expanding uh at uh and they went into france uh they they took belgium the netherlands
uh uh they annexed uh uh austria
and uh and got a piece of the of czechoslovakia and then they decided to
uh march into the soviet union and uh after after they took poland uh
uh cut up cut up poland together with the soviet union yes they were friends yes
they were uh no there was a non-aggression pact but between that was signed by robin trump and molotov right
i think both parties knew that eventually they would fall apart but at the time uh it gave the soviet union
a little more a piece of poland and a little more time to prepare what they
thought might happen down the road and and the german the germans
had you know the the time and the in the ability to pretty much
conquer all of western europe do you think stalin really knew that it's gonna fall apart why would somebody like
stalin trust somebody like hitler but why did he blunder so bad not to
um read the intelligence that was coming his way oh his troops are amassing on the border of the soviet union he didn't
trust his own intelligence apparatus here's one one example uh um there was a german communist um who
uh who went on the ground when hitler took over and he would he went to japan as a journalist his name is richard zorger
and godzilla had really really good into intel about what the
japanese would do and not do and it i forgot exactly what it was but uh it was it came to moscow and stalin
totally totally ignored it and and when zorga was uh uh captured by
the uh by the japanese uh the soviet union denied that uh he was one of there so he was executed
uh that the paranoia again uh does a lot of damage we when you don't
when you don't believe your own intelligence apparatus why why bother having one
yeah i mean there but i'm sure there's contradictory information coming in from the intelligence apparatus so it's difficult
i mean first of all nobody likes to be disagreed with especially when you get become more and more powerful and then the intelligence apparatus is probably
giving you information you don't like but it's often negative information about yeah uh
basically information that says that the decisions you made in the past
are not great decisions and that's a difficult truth to deal with yeah so there you know in the modern times if
we hop around briefly is uh vladimir putin has been
um not happy with the intelligence of the fsb thereby at least if you read the
news right uh choosing uh to put more priority to the gru for
the intelligence in ukraine right but i guess i suppose the same story
happens there as it dis throughout history is paranoia i i give you an
example that that comes from a very reliable source
uh and that my my best german friend uh worked as a chemist in the
anastasi east german intelligence and uh he
eventually uh he he rose to the rank of major and was in charge of
the forgery department it's very likely that he made passports that i used to travel
he was aware that there was intelligence that that was uh that was collected to start he was really good they had about
a thousand people in west germany undercover agents uh some of them in government and the
central committee of the party and the decision makers ignored it because it didn't quite fit in their world view it
didn't quite fit into their plans so uh and and one one delicious uh
uh thing that i just want to add on to this when when gorbachev uh
um wrote his book about perestroika and glasnost uh the
the east german uh rulers did not like it they were much much more orthodox so
they had to print the books in translation guess where they wound up they were in the host they piled up in
the hallways of the stasi they they bought the entire print run
it's fascinating uh so but let's backtrack so operation barbarossa
invasion a hit right to the soviet union and then hopefully that leads us all the way to east germany west germany right
after the end of the war so what happened was that the soviet union rolled into the eastern part of germany
and the the western allies uh took a larger chunk
which was eventually it was occupied by the three
allies the french the the english and the americans and the eastern part was occupied by the
by the soviet troops and the soviet uh troops actually uh conquered berlin yeah but as a and
and as an in a contract they uh decided that berlin would be ruled by the four allies
and they all had you know had free access to uh
that city i was born in the east german part which very quickly became uh
ruled by communist socialists the the communist party in the socialist party united and
but the leaders of that new party for all communists it's nevertheless called democratic
yes the german democratic republic which was formed a couple of months after i
was born i was born into a the remote southeastern corner uh of of east
germany and uh interestingly enough uh genetically i'm only half german
the the other half the other half is czech and polish nice because
uh where i grew up you know we i could walk to the nicer river which was the uh
border with poland and and it was only about an hour by bus to get to the czech
uh border so that's why i'm a mix so okay so east germany after the war
was communist socialist yeah then the west germany was representing the western world with the
right democracy and what the united states did when this was
really really very uh forward-looking very strategic the the
marshall plan to rebuild the economy in the west as compared to what the soviet union did
they whatever they hadn't destroyed on the way in they took with them uh
on the way out for reparations because you know they had every right to do that but it was uh not a good idea because
you know east germany was always behind in economic development uh to to their
western counterpart so when you're young as today but when you were young you
were clearly an exceptional student yeah you're a brilliant academic superstar
let's go to your childhood what's a fond memory from childhood that you have
in being woken up to the beauty of this world and sort of
being curious about all the mysteries around you that i think ultimately lead to academic um success
or was it the fondest memory that comes to mind is my first kiss
how's that do you want to go to the details of that what uh what what what what'd you make of that
would you make that guess what what would that teach you about yourself and human nature and all that it taught me only in
hindsight at the time i was just like my god i was head over heels in love i was 16 years
old yeah and i i knew in those days i admired girls i i
knew that girls were like uh sort of um uh magical beings they were not capable
of doing evil things they were beautiful and they had to be adored and one of them
actually loved me too she came after me initially right and that was like that
was that too was magical for you oh my god yeah uh and i
literally i uh dedicated that's when i started studying up until that point i just like
did whatever i had to do to be in a minor students and that's when i started studying in every a that i got i
dedicated to her sometimes explicitly because i knew i was going to take care
of her you know when as i grow up so you're going to have to work hard in this world to be somebody that could be
adored by the by those you lost yes you're right you know that that case
the next day i was running around in school with a grinnell in my face
and maybe that in some way that grin never fades so um
what about the heartbreak that followed the heartbreak surely but just to uh
expand on this a little more yes because
that that passion that i had was an indication that eventually love
would play a big role in my life i wasn't aware of it i was just directed at this one girl but uh
but that you understood that that feeling oh my god that taught you something like that you're somebody that
can feel those things absolutely and there's that's a strong
part of who you are and therefore it will also be a part of directing your life trajectory
yeah so we we were an item for two years uh i lost my virginity
congratulations she was not a virgin at the time she see my my my competitor was uh
there always is a competitor isn't that how it works he studied medicine in in college already in which
ways was he better than you uh he wasn't he was older and he was more experienced yeah and he was going to be a doctor and
i but you know i was there and he was not ah the you know presence wins yeah but
you still had big dreams you wanted to be a a 10-year professor yes yes so you you
still want to outdo that guy oh yeah and she he eventually told me that uh
you know he was he was not in a picture anymore so it was back and forth back and forth
and uh the our senior year we were an item and uh and i was just dreaming of uh you know
the future but sort of we didn't figure out that you know in those days if she went to
college in berlin and i went to college in yena and the the distance
to uh between the two cities was too it was too much to
for a weekend visit you know public transportation was very slow and nobody had cars and
so uh so the circumstance of life you just yeah and so we interacted
with a couple of letters and then i got the goodbye letter oh my god that hurt
i can still feel it [Laughter] you know when that's that's a good thing that you could feel that pain
that's still part of love that's that's that the pain of loss is still part of love and then you kind of
change that you shape it and you give that love in deeper more profound ways to future people very well put but at
the time it emptied me out yeah if if i had uh a tendency uh to you know
to have suicidal thoughts i might have killed myself it was so you would you say that was one of the darker
moments of your life um let me see
yeah as a single moment yes so you know i'm i still remember uh
we had a mail slot in the front door and i
i was expecting a letter any day and there was the letter i go upstairs into my uh my bedroom and i open it and i
read it and i was just like the life went out of me
you're just there alone and you have to experience this pain alone so but now you're deeply alone in this world yes
because i didn't have a there was no emotional relationship with my parents
um i i literally had nobody so this love you have in you had no
had no place to go it was choked off all right so uh but i
uh what i did was i um i i wanted to go on right
and so i threw myself into the study of chemistry i outworked
all of my fellow students in a big way i just like i worked my ass off and
since i was pretty smart too i just aced practically everything and for the first
two years in college and look we go to college there all these pretty girls and their dances and everything we had this
this great student club where uh i i didn't look at any girls like
eventually i knew i was going to you know want to have female companionship but love uh-uh no more
than hurts there's a song that goes love hurts yeah yeah i know that one
that's true there's actually many songs that have a similar message yes um
so during that time during your excellence just being an exceptional student
of chemistry let's go to your story so um in your book deep undercover my secret
life entangled the allegiances as a kgb spy in america and in the really really
excellent podcast series that i've been listening to it's people should definitely listen to it's called the agent
you document your time as a kgb spy before during and after
can you tell the story when you first were contacted by the kgb those how you were
in invited the offer to join was made well it was a big surprise and i i never
thought of myself as uh as a potential agent you know i i was going to be a tenured professor
and joined the ruling elite because in in in europe tenured professors are few
it's not like in the united states you know anybody who teaches at colleges as a as a title of professor easy now
it's true yes that's not a criticism so we should also clarify that to any professor or not
it is a very prestigious position throughout history of europe
and i would say especially communist i don't know actually know the full landscape of the respect but at least in
the soviet union where i grew up it's a prestigious position absolutely was uh and the the town of yena had about a
hundred thousand people live there and um i would it's a wild guess but maybe 30
tenured professors and they were part of the ruling elite i was trying to do it as much as i can to live
the good life right you know you know have access to things that uh that are nice
yeah but i think the powerful thing about being a professor in that context of
east germany is the prestige and the feeling of superiority
you know i i was full of myself you know when when when you are the best of the best and i and i in my third year
i received a scholarship uh the karl marx scholarship uh that was
limited to 100 concurrent recipients in the country so my god no i i was full of myself i i
believed in myself hook hook line and sinker and and and i was also uh
uh this uh i got a lot of accolades from
teachers and fellow students they were feeding the ego the old i mean yeah you have to believe in
yourself uh often when you're young to truly try to excel and and you sure as heck
did but you know as a balance you need a mentor somebody who puts things in perspective and i didn't
have one my father was a non-entity and nobody else they they all looked up to me yeah
i was an up-and-coming guy right so there's no father figure that put you in your place not at all and i give you one
extreme example it was down the road when i fathered a child out of wedlock
that was in my fifth year i believe the the communist party in east germany was uh very moralistic if you did that
they would have a talk with you and give you whatever a severe reprimand
nobody even mentioned a word about this so yeah so this is this is how this ego
gets gets nurtured but anyway getting back to how the kgb uh uh came in contact so they most likely
got uh knowledge of me by you know looking at the stasi uh records this stuff what's stasi oh
that was east german secret police stat zika height security for the state
there's that word security again [Laughter] and that they pretty much kept the
record uh on on everybody in the country and um so when you when you look through this
in and and this is what the kgb was looking for they were looking for candidates particularly for this kind of job that
they had in mind for me for candidates uh who were not you know in their mid 20s
uh who were not fully developed yet but mature enough to to get there
uh and and and still young enough right because because at that level of maturity you can test whether they can
handle this kind of yes absolutely right so and uh
one day i got a knock on my door and my dorm room door was on a saturday
and they knew that i was by myself how did they know it
uh we had a i pieced this together and we had an
exchange student from the soviet union and he was next door and to me
and he you know he he befriended me so he got to know me a little bit
and and the pattern was that my roommate would always go home for the weekend
and of course they also knew which door to knock on even though there were no name plates right so
somebody knocks uh and uh i knew it was a stranger because if if it had been a student
the the pattern was that we would knock on the door and then go in we wouldn't wait for somebody to to let
us in so i didn't i waited for 10 seconds and i and he didn't come in i knew that it was
a stranger i said come on in and then came a person uh who spoke fluent german so that was
not a kgb guy there was a collaborator uh when and so he started making a bunch
of small talk he introduced himself as the as a representative of called seize yana which was the
optics uh um um company that made that was made really
really good optical instruments was one of the best in the world so it's it's like though you know
the the super prestigious company in that place right and he said you know
that he was a representative of that company and he would just want to find out if what my
plans were after graduating from college and at that point i knew he wasn't from
cause i sana because in those days there was no recruitment you when when you were done
if you were in the top 10 of the graduates you
would most likely pick to stay and get a doctorate right and the rest of them were assigned you
know where you had no choice so so that guy was
an idiot he he didn't know the basics about you interviewed him a little bit
to understand like oh sure you know i you know i started like feel out is this guy full of
because yeah there's a stranger showing up to your dorm room and i knew that at that point i know he was stasi which
was wrong but it doesn't matter because it was german and i had no idea that the kgb would be involved so i'm sorry to
pause briefly did you have a sense did people know that there's a stasi
type of organization that there is a large number of people doing this kind
of work in east germany in order for you to make that guess yeah we we we knew that the stasi
existed uh we we even had our uh james bond you know we had a series
uh called the invisible visor where and a stasi employee in east german would go
into west germany and hunt down nazis yes so yes the stasi was was known to be there and admired in part
or feared or both i i thought they were necessary and uh i admired them uh james
bond the read yes the reason i did so because i had no information to the contrary
i never knew anybody personally or even you know
somewhat removed who was uh uh followed by the stasi uh uh was uh
you know put in jail uh i had no clue i i had no clue that they did a lot of damage and that they
were like doing a lot of surveillance of of the east german population the same way the
kgb did for for the soviet union so for me to
be talking to somebody from the stasi it was uh it um it raised my interest i was curious what
comes next because i sort of knew something interesting would be coming at
me and i i had no i had no other thoughts about that at that point so when when he was finally when he uh
he went and he went for the kill by uh reversing himself he said you know i gotta tell you that i really i really am
not from cal size you know i'm from the government okay thank you for pointing that out and
then he asked this question he says can you imagine to one day work for the government
and so i gave a pretty clever answer i said yes but not as a chemist
so we i answered the question that he didn't ask i helped him out
so we made an arrangement to me meet for uh lunch which in germany is the main meal
at the number one restaurant in indiana you know i still remember what i ate uh
what was that rum steak with uh with butter on top and french fries was my favorite
anyway um so when i get to the restaurant uh i saw this fellow sitting in the back
there at the table and uh there was another person at the table so i was a little bit hesitant because in those
days uh it was not unusual for for perfect strangers to share a table because there
wasn't wound enough uh tables and chairs and so forth so i didn't know if i could
approach him but he he got up and came to me and he took me to the table and he said
uh i want to introduce uh uh herman we work with our
soviet comrades aha kgb and then he he disappeared he
says i got something else to do i never knew his name i he just handed me over to the kgb
what was the relationship between the kgb and stasis as uh collaborators close collaborators or
just distant associates uh they were pretty close collaborators as i told you that uh you know they they they bought
uh forged documents that the germans made because the germans were better at forgery uh they also exchanged information but
they didn't trust each other 100 and and and i and i tell you why i know that
so they recruited me to send me to west germany
as i already said east germany had a thousand agents over there why would they have to want to have their own
yeah yeah okay this is a fascinating internal and external dynamic
of distrust yeah okay so there you are uh welcomed by the kgb when did the
offer the invite come well that took a while so herman and i uh had an unofficial relationship
for about a year and a half i would meet him uh maybe once a week once every two weeks
initially in his car but then uh uh he uh he um he took me to a
conspirational flat this was a an apartment that was uh occupied by
a a party member a lady single lady when we came in she would leave she left us
tea and cookies and then we could freely talk he also at that time gave me some
west german literature magazines to read which was of course forbidden so already i'm starting to feel somewhat
special and as we were talking about what they had in mind for me in general
i knew that i was going to be even more special because i would be above the law
i would i would operate outside the law of the countries i would go to as well as
east germany because you know that the magazines and uh and eventually when
when i joined up they told me i had better watch west german television which was also
not explicitly prohibited but it was uh uh something that could get you in trouble
so on many levels you're super special you're the gym yes yes so what was that
recruitment testing process like testing whether you
are you have what it takes to be a kgb agent first of all um
we had very in-depth talks on herman and i
uh about life and i i was i still am
very honest and sharing my feelings uh philosophical or personal personal
personally i even i even told him that i was shy around the girls uh he was giving you a relationship advice
or what how old was he so what was the dynamic can you tell me was it a father
son no older brother older brother brother yeah he was uh maybe in his uh
early to mid 30s and i was maybe 10 years younger and what languages did he speak oh you speak german he spoke
german pretty well oh but he's originally from ohio yeah with a russian accent
so i got in trouble one time with him when when i asked him is your real name german
he didn't like that he didn't like it what was he good with girls was was no no he just you know
i remember what he told me he says you know you got to understand one thing they're looking for guys too
that's that's all you know oh uh girls are looking good yeah it's right it's a competitive game yeah yeah don't don't
don't worry about it you know don't be so shy so that little flame of love that we talked about yeah in all the shapes
that it takes in our life did he talk to you about that that that could be taken advantage of that that
could be used or was it implied yeah but not in
it was not very focused not in great detail so let's uh so we talked about personal stuff and
you know like dislikes he gave me tasks for instance uh when my friend and i hitchhiked from from
east germany all the way down to bulgaria he told me to write a report about it what i saw so
fundamentally he wanted to see how well i can uh i can write
and how well i can report how well i observe uh he also asked me to write some
profiles about fellow students i don't believe that was for them to give him to the stasi it was just like
how well do i characterize people what's that that's important when you're talking about uh when i was in the u.s
active in the u.s i operated as a spotter so i did exactly that i wrote profiles about people
uh he also gave me some tasks to do that were rather unpleasant
um what uh he would give me an address and the name
of uh of uh the people who lived at the address and he told me to
go there ring the doorbell and find out something about a relative who lived in west
germany uh that is undercover exploration right
so you go you you make up a story and somehow win the confidence of your target
to tell you something that you want to know was that did that come naturally to you no no i hated it the charisma involved
uh which part did you hear charisma i think i didn't know that i had it it took you some time to discuss because
you know i was i always was and i still am to some degree a bit shy
uh i lost a lot of the shyness after moving to the south because uh here in the united states because
uh you don't have to be shy you know you can
let your love shine that's exactly right so but anyway i i hated doing that but i i did it well i still remember so i in
those days i had a i had a beard i i i rang the bell and tall handsome fella
yeah and uh and i i looked the part i said i'm i'm a sociology student
and i'm i'm doing a survey and i asked a whole bunch of questions can would you like to answer the questions
no problem and then i directed the conversation to
the lady's private life and and she actually gave me information she volunteered information
that i wanted to know beautiful i did well and the other one that i didn't like but i also did well
with when when herman drove me around the city and showed me a building
and he said find out what organization is in there what they do uh maybe get to know some people and i
did that pretty well also you know you have to be inventive you know to
to come up with a cover story and and i've always been quite uh uh inventive uh you know i'm a
storyteller and at heart and that i didn't know it then but you know but there was still
something unpleasant about it yes yes which part was well the shyness and then you know
you know i wasn't very comfortable lying i became comfortable down the road but
you know i i was brutally honest uh and never
never hid anything of me but you know over time
you lose that that uncomfortable feeling
and you rationalize that you got to do it there's only one way right and you're serving a good cause so you were talking
to herman for a year and a half year and a half and then how did that progress
yes so he said he finally i guess he sent a report to headquarters in berlin
and then he sent me uh on a three-week quote-unquote practice trip to berlin
this was the first time when i had an and like a con conspiracy conspiratorial
meeting where i would i had an address in a time and a code phrase and i met
another agent his name was boris these names me were meaningless they
were all like cover names right and so what was the code and the meaning what was then what can you give a little more
code i don't remember no but not the code but like what do you mean by code oh i tell you my the
the code we used when i when i met while i was active
i would approach the other person who i thought maybe the the person i want to meet we both had
some something to with us or on us to make us more likely
to be the right person so and i would uh i would ask him the
following questions excuse me or i'm looking for susan greene
and he's and he would answer yes you must be david stupid if if i
if i ask a stranger they would look at me how could i help you so yeah no one's
the wrong guy yeah it's just a low probability that that the right thing would be so it's absolutely nice
and it seems like a safe statement yes if it's not the right person exactly right you'll just come off you're absurd
or crazy or whatever you you would have you would have made a good secret agent you you i know i'm not
this is this is we'll discuss this uh i'm dressed like one
actually yeah where there's any dress code no just fit in
fit in no matter what and then be creative yeah figure out ways to ride
so anyways he give me some tasks and we and he and since i i had rented a room
in a house he gave me uh western literature to read
and we spent time together um and
there was a practice run to west germany actually there were two
and that was very important in hindsight i figured that out uh so
i traveled to west germany you know not to west berlin with an east german passport that was stamped that
that individual was allowed to go to the west and there was a
a part of the border that was only
guarded by soviet troops and that's where they smuggled me into west germany i got on
the subway uh and and then uh uh appeared in in west berlin no no no
americans no birds no french knew that i had entered uh forged documents or not
no no no this was a an east german passport it was real okay okay so uh and uh the first trip all
they wanted me to do is just walk around you know smell the air
you know have a beer or whatever and eat a sausage and then come back
the second trip i had a task very similar to the one that i had
back in yana to ring the doorbell someplace and uh talk to some people and that worked very
well as also i i should mention that you talk about
that you know eat a sausage drink some beer i suppose that's a good test too to
see how you behave under western like when first introduced to the western college like uh this is why i
might not make a good agent is when i first came to the united states and the
supermarket oh like bananas as many bananas as i want to eat
that i think i would that i think that would break me it's just just it's a shock to be uh to
have access to western culture you're getting very close to the reason they
actually made me do this these two practice trips the
when i first emerged on west berlin territory i felt highly uncomfortable
that was the enemy right yeah and i saw the cops everywhere and even those those cops had like light blue uniforms
nothing they weren't standouts so i was wondering you know if they knew that you know i had like kgb
yeah on my forehead you were paranoid that they would know they would see i was scared but i i overcame that so
that's can we just linger on that because i suppose that's a natural like if i give anybody on the street the
mission to do the mission you have to do is they would be paranoid that's the natural human
feeling is am i being watched do they know um like if you try to steal something
from a store you're there's going to be a feeling like are they watching me are the cameras
watching are there people watching me they all know that kind of stuff so you have to overco you have to be somehow
rugged and robust to that kind of feeling and overcome it yes exactly so and and uh
something very interesting happened uh while i was being trained in berlin i met a classmate of mine from high school
and he confided to me that he was recruited by the stasi to become
go as a spy to west germany and he also had this practice trip
and he peed in his pants he went back and told him i can't do that just from the terror the
yes that paranoia now this guy's career was over he hadn't he had an uh he had an
engineering degree he was a pretty smart guy he he was just for the rest of his life
and he's still alive i believe floating around and you know trading in uh
model railroads and stuff like that you mean do you think that experience broke them or they wouldn't let him back in oh i
see they yeah so this it's a test that if you fail you pay the bill i have no idea
that that uh you know something bad would happen if i failed that test but i didn't yeah
i didn't fail so and this led then to the offer all right
and after and you know boris was happy with me and he told his boss who was most likely the
the head of the kgb in in in east berlin and i had an appointment to meet in east
germany yes in east germany yeah all of east germany yes that's right
an appointment to meet with him and as we walk into the room uh
there was this huge desk and the little guy sitting behind it very very
uh just like little and not unimpressive nice
a lot of paraphernalia like you know the bust of jazinski on on on this desk
and and some some some paintings uh lennon and so forth
but when the guy opened his mouth he was like whoa
a huge uh psychological energy he spoke only russian
now uh and initially he would you know start about with five minutes worth of propaganda why we're doing what we're
doing i didn't need that i understood most of it uh but what i
when when i didn't understand i asked boris to translate and then then he sprung it on me and i was not
prepared he said so what are you in or not i was no i'm gonna i'm i hadn't made up
my mind i wasn't expecting that would come and so um
i said to him i'm not really trained you know there's a lot of things i need to learn and i
came up with a couple of really stupid things one one not so stupid but the other one was i don't know why i said
that i said for instance i need to learn how to drive a car and to type with the typewriter
and he he was he got really annoyed and he said don't worry about it we'll train you yeah but
i gotta tell you we need people who are decisive so i you got until tomorrow
noon to give boris your decision that made for a sleepless night
so what was going through your mind well i had uh this was almost 50 50. uh i i knew i was
gonna have a huge career a good career i would i was on my way
uh because you know this i was already employed by the university as an
assistant professor so that career would be uh to become a professor become a ten-year professor be a world-class yes
uh jenna had become my hometown i really loved the place it was my oyster
and and my family was my basketball team
i was you you loved playing basketball that's what you mean yeah so this is home is this home this is where your
love is home did you understand that the choice involved leaving yes behind yes
and and uh the one thing i didn't have the two things i didn't have an
emotional relationship with my mother and i didn't have a steady girlfriend at the time
i think freud would have a lot to say about that but yeah go ahead but the connection between those two but yes
yeah i'm sure by the way my my my friend gunther the one who worked for the stars he was also the stars he tried to
recruit him as an agent but he had a love relationship at the time and
uh he said politely no i i won't i can't so you didn't have that's the one thing
that really could uh would have helped me would have held you to this place is love so you got the career on the one
hand my basketball team the town that i would be part of the ruling elite of and
then we had this great adventure and the ability to uh contribute
to the victory the worldwide victory of communism and and stick it to the nazis
and of course the feeling that you're really special yeah james bond yeah what's
[Laughter] the the question do i want to be a ten-year professor or james bond yes and
and that's as funny as that sounds that was probably a difficult decision it was a difficult decision but fundamentally
it wasn't it and it wasn't my uh zeal
to to help the revolution it was my uh my uh what they called what they started
was looking for the kgb was looking for in in a character that they would send over a well-controlled inclination to
adventure okay [Laughter] yeah yeah james bond what do you say
and the love of women yeah it was yes sir but i i got to put this in right
here because i i'm telling people i have two things in common with james bond these are my initials jb
and and i got the girl too three times [Laughter]
yeah i mean that's and that's adventure yeah and and uh and and the ability to travel to the
west because the west was closed off to us we could go to foreign countries but they all had to be communist countries
you know i wanted to see paris because i i had fallen in love with the
onori balzac who wrote zach a phenomenal set of novels that i just ate
up and so i when i eventually did go to paris i knew all the places already because he described them all but anyway
so that one it was a it was 5149
but eventually it and you know when you when you do the side by side um intellectual comparison
that doesn't work it becomes a tie and then you know you just go with your guard and i said hey
i'm in so now that you successfully passed the test and you were sitting with this
unimpressive man and had the invite and had to sleep on it
and have made the decision to join yeah what was next i was just told you know that i was
being recruited by the state department of east germany i was going to become a diplomat
i must have had some paper but i forgot because you just by saying so then that would
that wouldn't have worked there's some kind of document that says yeah yeah and that was the only entanglement you had to that to that place no love no
that's just a basketball basketball giving up basketball was huge for me i loved playing that game
i started playing basketball when i was 18. that's a little late are you better offensive defensive what do you like
more do you like to shoot from a distance do you like um i was a runner i i was very very quick on my feet
and i was a good jumper too i typically pay uh played the uh
the the four position you know what's that uh forward oh the forward position
forward position but anyway um so that that that was the hardest uh uh for me
to give up um but and the the other thing that i remember i had to do to hand in my party document to the
party secretary of the university and uh he made a comment
yeah we probably won't hear much about you but we know that you're going to do something very important so he thought i
had an inkling that i'm going i'm gonna go someplace uh undercover or something
like that and then i packed my bags and got on a train uh to berlin for
another one of those secret meetings with uh my my new handler
nikolai so and he came another test that that
would have been quite easy to fail so all right
had lived uh in vienna for six years in a dorm even when i became a an employee of the
university they didn't they didn't have apartments i was still living in a dorm in any one in a single
room with a bed a chair and a table and a toilet down the down the hallway
so i figured you know berlin kgb i'm gonna get a nice apartment right
and so uh nikolai took me into his car we started talking
a little bit and then he said i have a task for you already your first task is to find yourself a place to live
i mean i don't think i showed it in my face but you know my heart my my my
heart dropped like down to into my pants i i knew this wasn't nearly impossible
because there was a severe shortage of uh of housing in in in everywhere in germany east germany
and all the apartments and homes were controlled by by the government you you know there were long waiting
lists uh nine i know i knew couples that were promised maybe to get an apartment
uh five years down the road so and then they would postpone their
decision to have a child anyway this wasn't possible oh well
you know but this was a test i'm gonna and so again because i had to be inventive now i had to figure out how to
get out of an impossible situation i didn't realize it then at all i just like went with a flow you know
what do i do so what i did i went i took the the train the city
train uh to the very last stop a little uh town called acna
and i wandered around in that town and knocked on doors and asked people if they knew
where somebody might have a place to live and after a couple of hours somebody said there's this lady that and
she gave me they gave me the address and i talked to the lady and she said i happen to have a place that you might uh
that where you might be able to stay it was an outbuilding and
i don't know what it was what it served it was not a garage it was concrete and it had
a bed and a chair running cold water and a stove a cold
stove that was my was going to be pretty basic pretty basic that's the basis are
you kidding me that's the uh toilet across the the yard of course yeah well all the essentials
what are you complaining about you were right you're right you had to run the uh the
special the james bond had to run this special operation out of the yes
to my credit and i think that that uh that established part of my reputation i
didn't complain at all to nikolai that was part of the test probably yeah i just told him you know i found something
and so uh for six months i would get up in the morning get on the
train and walk around in the city you know did some operational stuff and
operational training i went to the library did a lot of reading in the library
and then i found the basketball team that i could join so at least i could take a shower to uh twice a week
um and uh and apparently
i it took about six months that i was still on probation because after six months nikolai one day
we were still meeting in his car he said he handed me a key he said
i'm gonna take you to your new apartment now i and i didn't know this you know
that now i was really in okay imagine you know the hurdles you have to
jump over and how many times you can fail but you know but not complaining
not asking questions yes i mean that was something you've written about um i think he wrote that bosses do
not like to hear complaints or problems they prefer solutions that's right so what was your interaction like with the
bosses is that essentially um represent
the way it went forward as well i no complaints get no complaints no arguments no no
i know this better i was taking it all in now the the the technical guys you know
they taught me something i didn't know that made sense uh um what nikolai some of the stuff that he
taught me was somewhat questionable he was a generalist
and some things he didn't know really well so i could have like asked probed a little bit but i didn't
so i just played along so this new apartment was uh it was a studio it had a
kitchen with running cold water and the bathroom was just one flight
down the toilet not a bathroom uh one flight down the stairs an upgrade it was a big upgrade
yeah and he gave me uh i think he gave me a thousand mark to buy buy furniture
and in that place i actually i also bought a tv and started watching west german television so
so it i finally had a decent place to stay
um and the the my training in berlin took about two
years what was the training what were the interesting aspects to the training
what were sort of if you do an overview systematic of what was the training process what was difficult right what
are some insights that generalize to the training process of what it takes to be a kgb spy right
so uh let me start with a trade craft so i was taught morse code that took a
while uh i i was uh instructed in how to you know
use a shortwave radio and to receive uh you know the the shortwave uh
transmissions with morse code i was taught uh uh in a encryption and decryption
algorithm manual algorithm you you might be interested that eventually
i figured out uh at least one of the patterns uh the the algorithm was such that
the and this was all about digits like uh and the algorithm was such that in
the end the uh the digits that were used to decipher
other digits that were handed that were sent to me by a shortwave radio there were let's say if there were a
hundred digits there were an equal number of ones twos threes fours fives six and
seven and up until zero and i was told that these uh
algorithms these manual algorithms were good for about 300 uses after that they
could still be deciphered i'm assuming nowadays that wouldn't take as much yeah with
computers for sure but there's probably they're probably designed in a way that you can manually
sort of uh it's efficient and convenient to use them manually well not to optimize cryptographic security is to
optimize it's like the balance security and like humans being able to actually yeah no i got to disagree it was neither
efficient nor convenient okay it would took a long time when what was what was significantly
easier to do uh but uh that would require you to have spy paraphernalia with you this is
what's called a one-time pad so you have the set of numbers on on the sheet of paper
that had to be developed i had to use iodine to make those numbers visible those
are known to be unbreakable unless they are used multiple times the same the same sheet of paper
because you know the person who encrypts has the same set of numbers as the person who decrypts
and one one time use you cannot figure out what
the message is oh interesting but this is a quick way to communicate from one person to another one time one time well
one time when i had a pad with multiple uh paper right and uh the reason that they
gave me a manual one is because i literally i had only when i when i wound up in the
united states i had only one thing with me that uh
only a spy can have and that was a a writing pad with uh
where the first 10 pages or so were impregnated with a trace of a chemical that was used for secret writing
uh but you really would have to know what you're looking for to you know you see this pad it was bought at you a
walmart and can you explain a little a little further what what is the chemical here that
what are we talking about so how i i don't understand how it's possible to have a physical pad that does the
encryption without any computing i how does it include right so so no no
it doesn't it doesn't do any work you know so and the uh the communication that the
encrypted communication was uh was a set of uh uh groups of five
five digits and then another five and there's always a gap in between uh and
so let's say if i get this radio transmission i write them all down and then i then i use my uh develop my
algorithm and then i do mathematics either addition or subtraction the resulting set of digits
had that then had a one-to-one correlation to letters and this is an easy way to then do the correlation yes
well that's cool that's uh you're saying the algorithm was not efficient it was not oh the manual it took a long time
and and you can't make an arrow right uh would you know where can you is
it easy to debug no you no you do it twice you do it twice and that's how you change it's identical then you know
but like if it's not then then one is right and the other is wrong you gotta don't make mistakes no that's
right and i really didn't but anyway um so i was i was learning that
uh i was also uh told that i was required to become proficient
in another language and they gave me a choice and i picked english
that's what was the other one oh no they gave them pick one friend you know whatever is spoken in the west got it uh
what was what was what would be second to you would you think french because of paris what would you what why english
english was a no-brainer because i i was a straight age to a student in english without studying like it came so
easily to me yeah so that's why i chose it right uh so that was that uh then uh um
i uh i was taught the basics of um uh counter surveillance
you know some trickery and and uh surveillance detection routes where you
wander around in the city for three hours and
determine whether you're being followed or not that requires you to plan the route very
well i give you one example that uh that will illustrate that
it's my my favorite spot uh when when when i was in moscow i did a lot of that also um
and if my favorite spot was i it wasn't not well traveled uh
uh road it went down the hill and and curved and at the bottom of the hill
there was a telephone booth and when you open the door and pick up the telephone
you have to look back so it wasn't like this right it wasn't a giveaway this was normal it was natural
so yeah i could see if somebody would come walking after me you know these kinds of things or you would uh
you know use um public transportation uh big buildings
uh where you needed to use an elevator and see who's because
surveillance the the object of surveillance is to never lose sight of the individual who
you're surveilling because at that point you may miss the window where he does something that that you're looking for
so somebody always has to come close right did you have to also study
surveillance no counter surveillance and what helped me in in all my training
uh you know i would be uh would have a competition with the folks that were coming that were
following me and me and i beat them every time uh they were at a disadvantage because
one of them always had to be close and and if you saw the same face twice you know
that you were being followed and i had a very very good uh memory for for faces so basically figure out a fixed route
and then a fixed route that allows you to uh survey the area and then record the
faces you've seen inside your mind and if uh you see multiple times a single face that's that's a bad sign and
they they could they could uh you use uh different clothes yeah uh but they didn't have
was face masks yeah the cia does nowadays they can give you a different face
within seconds yeah so
i mean again you talk about paranoia
is that part of the is that a big part of the job uh counter surveillance like being
constantly paranoid that you're being watched yeah i was supposed to isn't that quite stressful so is that is that one of the
is that actually an effective way to operate uh no but it sort of becomes a routine uh i was told to do it uh while
in the u.s uh once a month and uh okay it's like a cleaning out oh
not every day no no no no no once a month or before i would say mail a letter with
secret writing so i was sure that you know nobody saw me put an envelope into
a postbox so this is one of the tools in your toolbox so there's morse code there's yes the decryption and
encryption there's the kind of surveillance photography photography um making making micro dots
you know what a micro dot is well that's uh that's uh you use
you you take a photograph and you use a microscope in reverse
and make that photograph really small so small that it's like the the
head of a pin that can be used to uh hide under opposite stamp
yeah in reality i knew how to make them but in reality they
they never asked me to to make use of that uh technique so it's a sort of an encryption mechanism for photographs
yeah so what we do nowadays is an embed code in in uh pdfs and stuff like that right
yep beautiful okay all right so that that was a learning a training process both in the physical space
yes algorithmically is there other things oh you bet uh
interestingly enough the uh i was um the first book i was given to read was
the history of this uh these uh communist party of the soviet union
also understand that's interesting because you said you had to read western literature yeah that too how much how
much reading so history how much history of politics geopolitics
not culture but they made me read that document uh other than that
i wasn't supposed to study the soviet union i wasn't supposed that that was not and i didn't when they sent me to
moscow it wasn't to learn russia russian right it was to learn english the the second document they gave me was
the the constitution of west germany and then i got lots of magazines and
stuff like that as i told you i was also told to
watch west german television which i which i uh embraced with a vengeance because it was
better than east german so i would get up in the morning and have a little breakfast and watch
the german version of sesame street and that that that helps you um that
helps you get an understanding of the culture if you have to do any kind of
uh interaction yes kind of spying then you have to be and be able to effectively integrate well you also have
to know like and that would have been easier uh if they had sent me to west germany you
know all the soccer teams you know stuff that everybody knows when i came to the u.s i knew very little stuff that
everybody knows that's why i had to be very cautious and you know take it in over time anyway
uh and the the last thing i want to mention is uh they uh i was strongly encouraged to
expand my my cultural education in other words
go to visit museums uh go to the theater uh not so much movies uh opera
read read books from all kinds of authors that was important to them and once a
month i had to write a report what i did but the interesting thing there was not
a there was no curriculum there was no agenda there were no check marks it was all ad hoc you know now you do this and
then you do that uh and and a lot of this also they relied on my
initiative again i mean that's part of the evaluation too uh are you able to have creative it's
interesting that they're like developing a james bond type of character here which is what's the reason to go to the opera
as you become yes cultured in a certain kind of way where perhaps that makes you um more charming more charismatic in
terms of your ability to integrate yourself in different situations you are absolutely right i
i was i was uh when i came to the u.s
after about two years roughly i was cultured enough to
not uh make a bad impression at it at a diplomatic soiree in washington dc i
mingled freely yes all right and and and so the whole idea was for me
to sort of reach into the upper uh realms of society where
the targets would be juicier than you know the worker bees
and how did you end up in moscow why yeah what is that journey well so i uh i told
you and i started studying english so i started back from scratch you know i had went and they paid for a tutor
and i went from like english 101 and that i went through that in a couple of months then and then i got another
guy with whom we i expanded this we had conversations rather than working from a textbook
and i and i worked like a maniac i threw myself into the study of of uh
uh english like you wouldn't believe um and and my inspiration came from
vladimir lenin i had read somewhere in a book that when lenin was in exile
he studied german and he learned 100 german words every day new german words
so i started reading newspapers and every word that i didn't know i wrote down on an index card
german english and i piled them up and so i really learned 100 new english
words every day i know this because i counted them and i had a system how to do this
um so you take your index card and you have five categories it's a really good way to learn road by
road uh so you got category one that's the new ones and you got category five
so you start with uh with five five you already
had right four times if you have it right again it goes up go ahead to the
archive oh like long-term cold archive yeah yeah four if you get it right it goes to five
if you get it wrong it gets relegated to three so and so you go through this
and and occasionally i would throw the archived things back into one
so i really i really acquired a phenomenal vocabulary when i was done
with my english my vocabulary was significantly higher than the average american because i i
didn't discriminate whatever word i didn't know i learned which is not necessarily the best way
because you know english has a lot of synonyms right yeah and uh and one synonym is
usually the preferable one and and i when i first interacted with people i
very often used the one that wasn't as good and people found
that i you know i have an interesting way of talking they didn't know what that meant but yeah well so it builds a
good foundation for a language just getting a large vocabulary yes it's really interesting there's something i
do which is called space repetition which is a programmatic way of doing this kind of system that you've developed yourself
which is if you successfully remember a thing it's going to be a longer time before it
brings it up to you again yeah now that's requires a computer
to keep track of my information if you have cars that's a really interesting pile system one two three four five you
upgrade it one two three four five maybe i wouldn't go to the archive and go to number two to pile one right away maybe
i would go to like i don't know pile five perhaps is probably the right place
to put it because you have to go through the full step again but that is a really powerful way to uh
learn definitely language but also facts like people that go to medical school disconnected facts yeah uh and and you
pretty much when you're done you you know what you know yeah you don't have that again to use it to integrate it into the music of
language that's more difficult that's why you talk exactly right is that there there's a charm i mean maybe it's not good for spycraft
but there's a charm to this kind of to having an accent and using words incorrectly but
confidently there's a because language isn't a simple formula language is the play of words so you're
actually using the incorrect synonym it you know as a uh
you know if instead of saying i'm cold saying i'm chilled yeah something like
using off beat words can actually be part of the charm so it's interesting if you can learn how to use that correctly
uh because i i've know a bunch of people with the russian accent and i feel like they get get away with saying a lot of
ridiculous because they're able to sort of leverage the charm of the uh non-sequiturs and by
the way by the way just one one thing um you talked about using a computer when i had my first personal computer
i actually wrote a program that does that it does that by the way when was that one because you were
a world-class programmer for time yeah very good programmer
when did the pc was probably 1984 1984 when did you fall in love with programming when i went to college in
the us and part of the core curriculum was that you were required to take a course
in computer and it was mostly just you know talk but we also had to learn a
language uh we had to write some programs in fortran which was what five at the time
it was a it was a dumbed down fortran but
listen so i i see the ability i see what what you
can do with this i program the sign curve and then i divided
the design curve into really really small rectangles and then ran the program and it came up with the right
area wow this is great that's incredible it's incredible it's so powerful
it's uh you're creating you're creating a little helper yeah that helps you understand
the world to help you analyze the world and so on uh we'll we'll return to that because it's interesting okay so you
have so many interesting aspects to your life but in moscow so yeah no let me let no let me how i was sent to moscow okay
so one day i had a visitor from moscow uh and he came to visit me in my
apartment uh together with uh nikolai and he you know we talked and then he
said so how's your english i said i pulled a book from the shelf and said i can read that without the help of a
dictionary oh that's interesting and he said you know what i'm we're
gonna uh send you a tape recorder and you just talk say something you know for 20 minutes
whatever you want to talk about and they sent this thing and two weeks later
i was on a plane to moscow because yeah i also spoke
english sort of the british variety of english with not a strong german accent because
i've always had the ability to imitate others and sounds there was an innate ability i would uh
you know when when when we were in a lab and as students i would very often not do uh
monologues uh imitating east german comedians you know i just impressions
yes yes i'm not good enough to to make a living out of it but uh
that raised some interest and so i went they sent me to moscow that was
the first time on a plane by the way um and uh i had a conversation with two
ladies who spoke english one was a russian a professor at
laminas of university she was obviously kgb that was her cover and the other one was an american-born
lady oh by the way she was an actual professor and using that as a cover or is it just a story
no i she said she was a professor she may have taught there too and that's an interesting distinction yeah one is like
a story you tell people no and one is like you legit are doing the thing but it also yeah there's a couple anyway
that's that's that's the intrigue interesting aspect of how to be a good
liar you might you might as well live the lie yeah exactly right uh so uh and the
other one was an middle-aged the the russian was pretty young the other one was middle-aged
american and uh and so we talked for maybe a couple of hours and then they
withdrew and i was left alone eventually my my liaison he came back in and he
said it was close but the american thinks you can actually uh
become you get close enough to become becoming a native speaker of american english
and he said the russian was very doubtful so i think wishful it was a tie
literally wishful thinking prevailed so uh within a couple of weeks
i was moving to moscow and what
what was the task in moscow and what how long were you in moscow two years
and what was the task there is it training or is it espionage no it was training it was uh
so it was i th the american american-born became my tutor i met with heart twice a week
uh i uh i also listened to a lot of bbc
shortwave bbc worldwide uh i read more english books so a lot of that was
about the language and the culture of english american and and
i did phonetics exercises nice every night
i had a tape that was about a half hour long
and they would say a word and i would repeat the word say a word repeat the word and it was it's mostly about the
vowels by the way most of the accent and uh particularly let's say coming from
german into into english but also russian it's the violence are we talking about the
so you would have a single word a word apple and you would just say apple yes
american english or british no american english and and i give you one uh example that
almost nobody gets right the difference between hot and hot [Music]
you know yeah yeah you know yeah and and german speakers it's very nice you know which one uh
for everyone is different for example uh i could say this in a podcast something that my brother struggles with i
struggle with too when i first came to this country to learn english is there's differences there's
embarrassing differences uh like beach and right
and you get so as a young kid also you get so nervous that i don't want to say the wrong thing i um
i can also say that this is almost as a jokey thing but uh there's a there's a famous philosopher
emmanuel kant and you can uh guess which other word is very similar to that so
there's a there's a nervousness about the what is that that's interesting i
mean and germans probably have a different uh tension of like what is hard to learn the
difference between the pronunciation of the vowels or the control of the vowels yeah it's interesting so you had to
really master this daily exercise and you know and this this was my discipline i did this every night routine boring as
hell uh so english was the focus and i also had interaction with some
agents who had operated in the united states as diplomats on a diplomatic cover they
would come and talk to me a little bit and tell me and and sort of prepare me
what was ahead of me and then i did a whole lot of operational training particularly
surveillance detection that was big i also they also taught me how to drive a car in moscow
finally one skill you need what's uh surveillance detection okay so this is what when when you find out whether
you're being followed ah gotta gotta got it so it's the enter uh yeah the the abbreviation that's used in uh
congress and and yes uh in uh intelligent circles is sdr surveillance
detection route you know when they say that you know what that is uh and and that was it uh and a few
other things you know one-offs for instance uh i was once uh
taught uh to read silhouettes of ships when you see a ship from a distance what kind of
a ship it might be they they thought this would come in
handy actually that they uh there was in in 1982 andropov started uh
a campaign was uh now i forget the name operation something something where everybody who
was in the west was supposed to uh look for signs that uh the west was uh uh
getting ready for war and i had an everybody had an object to uh
to pay attention to i had a uh a harbor and military harbor in um
in new jersey uh near red bank it was called earl weapon
station and this code name for that was early so they asked me to just
wander by there to see if there was something unusual going on because the soviet union were at that
point it was ronald reagan were really afraid that reagan was going to start a war they were absolutely 100 afraid of him
is there something memorable to you on a personal level on a philosophical level about your time in
moscow something that kind of stays with you outside of the training stuff maybe
like the details of the training you love the answer you will love the answer uh
i i was uh really guest i was given tickets to two uh
performances by americans uh there was a theater troupe that
played our town uh and then there was this i forgot the name of the guy but uh uh
you may not be old enough have you ever watched hee haw uh maybe uh there was a it was a country
music show real kitschy but uh the star of hee haw
uh was giving a concert in moscow and i guarantee you at least half the
audience were kgb oh man and at the other end the uh uh
um the the the opposite of uh of of a highlight was my
visit to the uh to to to the mausoleum where lenin
is still still today there there was so
there wasn't nothing you know he was he was my hero but he he looked like a wax figure
and and and you walk by there there was nothing inspirational not not it was not a religious experience
nothing it was it was a big old nothing is that did did your
faith and belief in communism start to crumble at some point here is that around that was still pretty small what
i did notice that uh the standard of living in in moscow was significantly lower than
in east germany the uh uh in the supermarkets you could
you could expect uh with reliability that you can find canned fish and
mineral water everything else was whatever and if you saw a line and at a
store you just line up you don't even ask what they have because if you don't like it somebody else will it was it was
uh not poverty but it was close to poverty there were a lot of drunken men in the
streets and uh this is the 80s no this is the late 70s
mid to late 70s and uh and also the they had these high-rise apartment
buildings that looked pretty good from the front but you went into the backyard
ouch you know yeah you're describing my childhood here okay
but it's interesting even even with the professor even with everything else um
it's interesting because i think the standard of living was much lower yeah right even in moscow yeah absolutely was
though the one thing that they always had at least in my days was in those two years there was always fresh bread in
the bullet snails yeah always yeah that's probably one of the memories i
have of childhood is well you're hungry a lot but when you
eat is bread yeah and the bread was good it was good i mean i don't i actually
wonder i wonder how good it was but i remember it being incredibly good to me it was
really good and and you know you had it from white to very dark and in all the varieties the other thing that was good
was um if you knew where to get it was four rubles
not only is it good vodka but it's a cheap vodka i like it yeah but you had to know whether you know this would be
like holes in the wall someplace well i think a lot of the way they operate i wonder if these germany's this
way but a lot of the ways that moscow operates you kind of you had to know
yes like there's a very kind of um if you make the right friends if you
give money to the right guy the guy the friend of the friend of the friend is gonna hook you up and this
there's a culture this this is how you work around a very big bureaucracy underground economy yeah underground
economy yeah you have to which is a boy um
such a stark contrast between between that and the united states the capitalist system
um yeah that was a very big culture shock to me to understand yeah the the different way
the different fundamentally different way of life but the interesting thing is
um human nature pervades both systems and there's something about the russian system that reveals
human nature more intensely because of the underground nature of it because you get to deal with greed and
trust and all those kinds of things in the united states there is much more power to the rule of law so there's
rules right and people follow those rules right they have to break the rules nonstop
well in in east germany and russia i believe uh theft
if you could get away with it was part of your economic activity yeah i have a friend you know who who i went
to uh school with uh up until my fourth year and uh we reconnected and he told me how he
survived you know he would you know he would just steal stuff and then sell it and or trade it
yeah thefts i mean it's a relative concept you are taking stuff bro bribery all
those kinds of things people you know um corruption you know it's a relative term
no i'm just kidding i mean it is you have to work around the giant barack bureaucracy about the
uh the giant corruption corruption builds on top of corruption and it just becomes this giant system that's
unstable as you talked about one last word yes
the two years in moscow taught me how to be
alone i had no social interaction not with friends not with women not no
i was the only interaction i had was with the folks that trained me so i was
alone it was a lonely two years for a person who who loves love yes
that prepared me for my first year and first and second year in the united states because i could not
interact socially without giving away that something was wrong with me i had to learn how to be an american they
didn't teach me in moscow they couldn't so if the first two years in uh in
america you had to kind of listen more than two you you bet the very first year i i couldn't even work
because i had to acquire the ducking documents and a social security card and a driver's license uh to get a job
and then when i had the job uh and i worked as a bike messenger
uh that gave me a good opportunity to listen as you know because these people did
they weren't very curious about me what was your name in east germany what was your name in moscow what was your
name in america okay so in my the name i was given at birth is ibrahim
nobody's so sexy when you speak in german the german asset i hate i hated that name they i didn't
like it it was it was very rarely used uh my mother named me after a famous
german painter ibrahimo my cover name in moscow was known as dita and in
in in the united states i became jack barsky in between i used a whole bunch of other names
that were associated with uh false passports that uh
i used the one of the names and i remember is william dyson because that is the
name that was on the canadian passport i used to enter the united states so how did you enter the united states can we
take the journey from moscow to the united was states assignment what was the
what was that leap what was like what uh just one one one thing in between i had
a three months practice trip to to uh canada that was that was a good
idea and i got to tell you this this one thing that happened there okay so
because you know the one one thing that that i like to tell people nowadays is
the one of the secrets to happiness is the ability to make fun of the worst situations that you're in yes absolutely
you see the humor yes okay so here's come here comes something quite humorous in hindsight at least
uh one of my the tasks that i had in in canada was to acquire a birth certificate
but the name the name was henry van randle who was born someplace in california and
i was supposed to you know write a little letter saying i'm henry van randle please send me a
copy of my birth certificate the fee is enclosed and uh and
and i uh i lived in a small hotel so the return address it wasn't visible
there was a hotel that was important so and it took like
three weeks and i get nothing four weeks i get nothing eventually i got annoyed and i i i
i mustered the courage to call them up for myself from a pay phone i
called up the office registrar whatever they were called in this in this town in california and i
and i yelled at them i said you got my money where's my birth certificate well a couple of weeks later it came
so i see the envelope this is the henry van randle yes i had prepared the
caretakers of the um of the hotel to that i'm expecting a letter from my
friend so i went up to my room i opened it and i was like yes yes this is a success and
and then i opened this thing and it was it was a copy of a birth certificate but it was stamped with big letters across
in red deceased now think about it so here's the dead people who was asking for that person
who was asking for more birth certificate uh i i had the presence of mine to to leave
okay i went to a couple of other cities i should have left the country uh but i know that the royal mounted
police was following me and i was given that information by the fbi later on
and they were you were able to just oh you were able to at least suspect that at the time i would through the the the
the i knew that i knew that there was trouble so i
[Music] my counter surveillance route
yes didn't discover anything so i kept on going uh i had to supposed
to i was supposed to visit two more cities and uh they were always one step behind what
what what is interesting to me is that they didn't catch me on the way out you have to show your passport
to the airline i mean i i was known by name i would in
the past because i had to give that to the hotel right and i and i escaped with that so how
would they buy a hair they would have to keep you on a list right yeah
yeah that's interesting but that requires like um a good computerized updated yeah
this was swiss air so [Music] well you got lucky yeah part of life is luck you bet so so
and and uh other than that the the trip to uh uh canada was a big success because
it it uh gave me the culture shock
that that i needed to not be blown out of out of the water and when i could get to the united states so
you hopped a few places in canada yeah and then swiss i even had an i even had
a relationship with a young lady uh canadian french canadian regular
canadian french canadian and she uh she gave me uh a book uh winnie the pooh because we
went to see the movie and then she wrote the dedication she says to the nicest german i've ever met
was she lying no or you don't know maybe
uh speaking of uh spycraft and that that led to heartbreak too no
that was uh sexual i was not at that point
ready for love not ready to return to that dog well and i was all i was already already
married in germany okay that woman i loved we should return to this yeah
so swiss air where did you land in the united states
oh when i came where did i land i i an american airlines uh flight from mexico
city to uh toronto but they made me deep plane in
chicago i have no idea i think there was over engineering that didn't make any sense to me
you know why can't the canadian just take it take a flight from mexico city i don't know with this stopover this
kind of nonsense yeah but okay but nevertheless that was it and then you landed in chicago right
and then tell me the story in america what was the day-to-day life now this is now you're a spy
no no no no i got to tell you another funny story yes so this is another uh
there's two things that happened that could have ended my career as a spy right then and there
so i'm uh so i'm i'm arriving in in um
chicago in the evening it's already dark uh i
i had no idea what kind of a hotel to take you know i picked one out of a out of uh yellow pages and then got a
taxi when i gave him the address he looked at me like a little funny
whatever what do i know you know just keep on going i need to get i need to get sleep because i was extremely
uh tense you know having gone through customs and border control
so and we were going in the southern direction and i noticed that the
neighborhoods were became less and less inviting didn't didn't know what that meant either and
i get uh entered the hotel it was a five-story brownstone
and something else looked funny so the reception desk was protected by plexiglass
not having enough background i didn't know that this was unusual because all i knew that
there was a lot of crime in the united states so i thought maybe every hotel was like that so i go up into my room
and drink a half a bottle of uh johnny walker red because as one does yeah
because i was so damn tense i just wanted to sleep i wanted to get into a coma which i did and yes and the next day i
woke up with a head it was twice as big as felt twice as big but you know i was prepared i had aspirin with me so
i killed the headache and went outside to see if i can get something to eat and uh
so i was right smack in in the middle of the south side of chicago i didn't know that this outside of chicago existed i
found later i found out where i was so it was time to
go very quickly go up there and at that point i decided i would uh
i would register at the next hotel on the jack barsky
so i went to the bathroom and i tried to kill kill off mr dyson by
burning his passport um unfortunately i was not trained in
how to train passport i don't know how to destroy passports
so i tried to burn it and these things were flame retardant and
it created a cloud of smoke and i'm looking up there and there's a smoke detector yeah oh no
okay so presence of mind i threw this thing in the toilet and then then took out a pair of scissors and cut
it into small pieces and flushed it down yeah if that smoke alarm goes off i'm busted
right if somebody if if some some criminal steals i had six thousand dollars on me in cash uh steals either
my passport or my or my money or both i don't know what to do yeah you can't
go to authorities you can't do there weren't there weren't any russian soviets in chicago do you have any
contacts no there was no there was no um there was no plan b for chicago at all
that's an oversight and i shouldn't i shouldn't have gone to chicago they they could have shipped me into uh um
uh san francisco or washington dc because both of them had soviets my end goal was
was to go to to new york fine uh you know i would have been a really really
uh dangerous agent if i had gone back and worked with a kgb because i could have told him all the things
how to do it right right so in that sense there is some
given the scale of the kgb there is uh some incompetence and some a lot of
encouragement with regard to preparing me to be an american is it was almost totally incompetent and that do you
think that's representative of the way they operate as uh there's an incompetence like to
the uh logistics to the strategies involved all that kind of
stuff none of these guys had operated as illegals they they were outsiders to
american society they had interaction with americans and uh but they all lived in you know in
new york they lived in a compound in in northern manhattan where they all lived together with their families and
and they most of the time they spent uh interacting with with themselves with their own people at work so they really
didn't integrate well they did not know what it's like to be an american to have a job
to to you know live like an american they didn't know it it's interesting that kgb didn't put a
high value to that kind of integration they didn't know what they didn't know yeah and and by the way this was mutual
do you think the cia had good knowledge of the russian culture ah
same thing and so um there was a lot of lack of understanding because good good intelligence could
have uh possibly avoided some of the uh high tension that situations that we
had when when in the 80s we got close to nuclear war so good intelligence would be
integrating yourself in society yes and understanding that ronald reagan was not a warmonger but he was talking about
the end times because he was a a christian but then that kind of integration can be dangerous because
you start to question the propaganda the narratives that on which the kgb is built oh yeah
he's built and and then they they have all they always have to have the options of ignoring the intelligence that
they're getting right well let me ask you this question sort of to jump around
there's a lot of conspiracy theories in this um in this current climate i mean
throughout history but now especially and some of the conspiracy theories
put a lot of power in the hands of the intelligence agencies like cia fsb
mossad mi6 they're basically the conspiracy
theories go that they control the powerful people in this world
and are able to thereby manipulate those powerful people and manipulate the populace
in order to deliver different kinds of messages and so on given your experience
with this kind of tension between competence and malevolence would you say there's some truth to those conspiracy
theories not one way i think i think there is there's collusion there's collaboration
but i would think that uh like for instance uh uh some folks in the cia and the fbi are
are being used by the ones that are really in power power is money power is wealth
i know power is going to go the other it can go both directions you can acquire wealth first which leads you to power or
you can acquire power first yeah power is also knowledge i understand
and uh in a in a position in society in the military or in intelligence but i i don't think
it's a straight one way that all the intelligence agencies control the powerful people in their country you see
what's happening in russia i mean putin dominates his intelligence agencies right
well uh so the question is which way the direction goes but you're saying that
there is um it's not one way flow of power i would think so
and and i also believe it exists but it's not as prevalent as you know not every conspiracy theory uh
pans out and most of them don't they're just damn rumors but that doesn't mean they don't exist i
guarantee you then there's there's collusion there's people getting together and not necessarily
uh preparing a specific action but more sort of a plan to go forward and
maintain the position or even you know uh strengthen the position that they already have so kgb who can generalize
fsb cia do you think a kgb agent would kill someone against international law if
they were ordered to do so so we talked about they did they did
uh and there's uh there's a famous uh case of uh one uh
uh i think it's vasily kuklov who defected he was a killer he was a
train killer and he had done assassinations in other countries
he was sent to west germany to kill a defector a kgb defector and he decided not to do it
he he talked to the guy and he said i'm supposed to kill you i'm not and then then he eventually wound up in the
united states i have a connection to this fellow because the kgb once
asked me to go to california and see if the guy still lives and works there and
we i found him and we looked at each other
so there was an active kgb agent looking at a man that he didn't know was
the the kgb defector looking at each other neither one knew who the other one was and i found out later
but he was able to survive yes and you know that there have been assassinations
not not a lot and uh you know that that we know of
a good point this is very difficult uh the the the question is
how many lines are intelligence agencies willing to cross
to attain to achieve the goal i i i think none of these agencies
have the ultimate line i i think eventually the last line will be crossed if
they believe it's necessary well i think you can justify a lot of things especially in this modern world
with nuclear weapons that you can justify that you're saving the world actually let me ask a few difficult questions and
we'll jump back to your time in america but vladimir putin
has been accused of ordering the poisoning and assassination of several people including alexander
livenenko early on all the way to alexey navalny do you think these accusations
are grouded in truth and we will return to a couple more questions maybe about
vladimir putin's early days in the kgb which would be interesting yeah there's a there's a phrase that i'd like to uh
say in response it's called plausible deniability i don't think putin gave a direct
command as they do that he would just maybe muse it would be nice if something were to happen
and then somebody picks it up and does it is there can you steel man the case
that uh putin did not have direct or indirect obama who who who would know
who would know you know just well the the international the reputation
perhaps um perhaps catalyzed by putin himself is
that he is the kind of person that would directly or indirectly make those orders
perhaps the case there is he's somebody to be feared and thereby you yeah we are sure
out there uh but the act itself the the
the poisoning of uh litvinenko and uh oh and then the the assassination of the
bulgarian uh markov and with the with the umbrella and and they all
directly traced back to russian uh soviet intelligence uh and so that's enough to be feared
right um my answer that i gave you is an educated
guess you know i i can't pretend to know this for sure but it's frustrating to me because
there's a lot of people listening to this would say would even sort of
would chuckle at the naive nature of the question
but if you actually keep an open mind you have to understand what is the way that intelligence agencies function
is it possible to the head of an entity intelligence agency not to
make direct orders of that kind where there's a distributed no the head of the intelligence agency would most
likely give the order even though it's compartmentalized yeah but but uh but not the the head of state not maybe not
the head of state although uh in the case this is the case
in the united states as well but certainly is the case in russia there are close relationships between
the head of the fsb and the gru and personal relationships not just even the
head of the fsb was now in jail there's there's uh interesting details
especially uh coming out recently around the war in ukraine so let me actually
ask about the war in ukraine all right what is your analysis of
the war in ukraine from 2014 to the full-on invasion of ukraine by russia in
2022 and february 2022 what um there's many questions
we could ask one is what are the sins of the governments involved
what are the sins of russia ukraine
america china are those sins comparable
who are the good guys and the bad guys that was more than one question though um let me just uh uh
give you my the basics about this savvy observers
saw this coming they were a very small minority uh because vladimir putin was pretty
open about what he told the world his mission was was the
re-establishment of a strong russia the re-establishment of something like
the the russian empire to unite all the russian-speaking uh uh people
uh in under one country and uh the world ignored him i mean he was open uh what was there was
at a conference in in france i believe when we we set this out out in the open
uh and then what we had uh in the united states we had wishful wishful thinking
you know obama had this reset with russia you know we all get friendly
and then when when uh putin invaded uh crimea we did nothing
so and it and it just escalated slowly but surely
it was pretty clear and then they said uh it was i think two years ago there was an essay published by uh putin
whether he wrote it or not doesn't matter but that was also out in public where he was again quite clear what he
was going to do now how do you do this with force
and uh and the the sins committed by the american government was that we ignored
it we were in engage in wishful thinking and we didn't stop it with sanctions before the shooting
started to push back i don't think you're fully describing
you are describing the sins of the russian government and putin i don't think you're fully describing the sins of the american government here
because not only didn't you're doing you're describing the miscalculation
so not only did they not pressure correctly with sanctions and so on and and and clearly
uh respond to the actual statements and the essays and the words spoken i know where you're going but
yes but they also at the same time pressured
pressured russia and they also as putin himself said sort of there's a rat and they pushed the rat towards the
corner by expanding nato and
uh and arming ukraine and well the military-industrial complex
is a machine that uh that led us um
and i think a lot of younger people i mean when i came to this country and
this is the country i love i lived through 9 11.
i lived through the full roller coaster of emotion yeah i am a at that time before that
and after was a proud american i went through the whole roller coaster of uh being sold i would say
a lie about the reason to invade iraq and even afghanistan
and i got to live through understanding of this military-industrial complex that
leads to the expansion of vampires of the delusion that we have
in the populace in in the government that convinces us that we are the good guys and somehow
with military force we can instill our values instill happiness the
pursuit of happiness that all men are created equal these ideas in into other lands and we can do so with drones
and we can do so with weapons and we could do so without significant cost to our own from our own
pockets and so this idea this machine doesn't just apply to afghanistan and
rock it doesn't just apply to yemen and syria it doesn't just apply to china it also applies to ukraine it also applies
to russia agree two thoughts if i may uh first of all one does not hear
the term military industrial complex in the public discourse these days eisenhower
warned about it eisenhower was a capitalist he was the president of the united states
uh so it exists and it is very powerful the more weapons you can sell
uh the more you have to replace them or send over you have to replace them so yes
uh the the other thing is uh there's also a messianic streak
uh that powers american foreign policy we want
to make the world just like us why don't they get it because they don't want to it's almost
like it's not communism but it's it's a very similar romantic idea that we can make
the world and fashion the world the way we are and and and that's the romantic side and
the sort of honest side but it doesn't work it it failed every time right you know
afghanistan is a royal mess and was would never become a functioning democracy i don't
know if if ukraine can become a functioning democracy so well i don't know if american weapons
can help ukraine become a functional democracy i yeah absolutely but there's a huge
amount of interest in seeing the world in black and white and selling the story of the world is black
and white that ukraine is the symbol of democracy
in this east eastern european world and russia is the symbol of authoritarian dictatorship
and the story is not so simple as as as many indices show ukraine and russia are
the number one and the number two most corrupt countries in europe they're two peas in a pod
one is bigger and and one is in this case the aggressor now you know two p's
the aggressor is still ultimately responsible and the person that throws the first
punch now there's a lot of people going to disagree where the punch came from yeah sure but there is there is magnitude yes
and and the struggle by ukraine for its sovereignty stretches
back to the beginning of the 20th century it stretches back even further than that but there's been the ukrainian
people are proud people and they've been in many cases tortured
by those that sit in the kremlin throughout the 20th century the the famine in the in the early 30s
and it's always it's never the middle class and upper class that suffer so is the lower
classes the peasants in that time that this history stretches back far
and this is yet another manifestation of that and um there's a lot of interest to play
china watches closely russia america watches closely and there's an
extra caveat here that there's nuclear weapons at play as well exactly
and it's what this is uh the situation is as dangerous as i have uh lived through
in my entire life i believe and beca because it's not necessarily at the highest point of escalation but it
will be in my view a protracted crisis and the longer that crisis lasts the
more of a chance there is of an accident yeah one rocket yep
there seems to be a strong incentive to prolong to do siege tactics to prolong
this conflict over perhaps many years which is terrifying
to think about yeah and over that one a single rocket can lead to
given that there's leaders that might not that might be losing their mind yeah
and ukraine is not part of nato the thing i'm really afraid of is that
somebody might think it's a good idea but for russia so putin might think it's
a good idea for russia to send a message by launching a nuke against ukraine
because they're not part of nato so surely the west is not going to respond what is the west going to do
yeah if uh if russia nukes ukraine to send a message
i don't know if anyone knows the answer to that question but it's a terrifying question and and i don't know the exact protocol
uh that needs to be followed to to launch a nuclear strike from from from
nato's end because we have several countries in nato that have nuclear weapons
so for let's say for france to fire a nuke does the united states have to agree
i don't know how that works i don't know if anyone knows how that works
yeah i worry now we have different very kind of anecdotal perspectives on these things
but the people i've interacted with in the dod department of defense in the military
there is a compartmentalization there is a bureaucracy and within that giant bureaucracy there's incompetence
we'd like to think that there is like really well organized for really
important things there's going to be the best of the best in the world that's going to execute and the correct
decisions both geopolitically militarily all that kind of stuff and i've seen enough to know
that competence at any level of government at any level in the military is not guaranteed let's go back to the
law of hierarchy the the government is is the biggest hierarchy there is
and so invariably politicians find their way to the top and once you have politics in uh
dictating substantive decisions they're they're
going to be weak or wrong it's i don't i don't know how this could work any other way there well right now we
have some functional idiots in in the central united states
government well let me because you did you said that um i think elsewhere you said that putin
was not a good kgb agent that's right a mediocre one but is an excellent politician yep
and a good organizer he was known as a really really good organizer when when yeltsin hired him as a
prime minister he he cleaned up the mess to because he
yeltsin was it was under yeltsin russia deteriorated tremendously and it
became sort of an uh a mix of an oligarchy and a criminal enterprise and
chaotic so he had skills that made him a good executive absolutely now let's go back
to him as a kgb agent he was a kgb agent i mean
uh you know according to him once a kgb agent always a kgb agent but 16 years let's say something like this
uh what do you think about from your experience
now you're maybe uh same age as him approximately the same age as him he's a little younger a little
younger what do you think about the kgb experience he had
made him the man he is what aspect of that from your own experience well how much
that does that define you who you are how you think about the world how you analyze
the geopolitics of the world how you analyze human nature now i got to tell you one thing he had a different type of
training than i did mine was one on one and he went to school so to speak so
classroom journey right uh so um but but uh fundamentally he he was
not a top agent and this is very simple to there's only one one thing you need to know he
he knows german pretty well so he where was he deployed in east germany
not in west germany not in switzerland not in austria that's where they sent the best right one would think
generally we're learning here right so this is your classification of where they send
the best you know there's people classify all kinds of stuff like uh what is the best university in the world what
is the best football team in the world you start to get a sense the good guys get sent the the best athletes get sent
to uh well we can disagree on this but the football team is but you have a sense and you're saying
that the best agents would have been sent one would think so now that this is not for a forcing argument but uh
uh i also have it from from a word from the horse's mouth uh
which horse what kind of horse what's the breeze oleg kalugin uh you you know who oleg
kalugin is and he's still he's still alive he was at one point uh the head of counterintelligence for the first
directorate espionage right and putin was in the first directorate and reported to collogan for a while
and oleg told me to my face that oleg was not an impressive
that agent trainee or aj vladimir putin was not impressive not impressive at all now he's biased
given his current situation and well yeah you know he could still
make it up because he had this big ruckus when when he was in parliament and called called putin the war criminal
about the war in uh not only could he make it up i wouldn't trust his analysis
i mean i have to you know what when people i've been working very hard even before
this war to try to understand objective analysis of all the parties involved you have to really keep an open mind
here to see clearly to understand if you are to try to
help in some way make a better world
in this case stop this war yeah or have
all the countries involved flourish bring out the best of the people remove the corruption and the greed and the
destructive aspects of the governments and let the people flourish for all that you have to put all the biases aside
all the political bickering all the um i don't know um
all the biased analysis and there's there's a lot of propaganda
that says that in fact putin was it was a good agent
how else would he rise to the ranks right because he he was a good politician and uh he had
made a lot of good connections and with within the kgb allow me to say something and you just
uh you just taught me a lesson and and and the lesson i i should have figured out myself
because i i keep on telling people that in the intelligence world you never know
the truth 100 so when you said all i could make that up of course he could have
but you get to a point where you're forced to make a decision or have an
opinion and then you use your best educated guess yes so i'm i'm going to
take the certainty of the statement that i made back yes because you it's quite possible that you're right well what
i've noticed about vladimir putin and this is true about for example donald trump and all those kinds of
um divisive figures that some for some reason people's opinion on the details of those people
are very sticky once you decide this is a bad guy yeah there's like a black hole and people are
not able to think like one act at a time you don't have to
like that doesn't somehow justify this that somehow doesn't uh
remove all the evil things that are done but you can analyze clearly each of the actions and to me it is interesting to
see how did this man rise to the ranks now you're saying that
to be a kgb agent there's a lot of skills involved uh and perhaps
raw um technical skill of spycraft
is perhaps not related to the skill of raising rising through the ranks right
and you're saying as a politician he was good at right lying and influencing uh
that is something that uh that is um significant as a significant uh talent
uh and ability that an agent must have that helps you
as a politician continuing the kind of thread of the role of kgb in defining the
the heart soul and mind of vladimir putin let me return to yuri bismanov who was a
soviet kgb agent that wrote a four-step framework for ideological subversion on
a national scale as practiced by the soviet union so the the four
steps are demoralization destabilization crisis and normalization he had a lot of
other kind of systematic ways of describing this kind of stuff so
can you speak to some of these ideas about the systematic large-scale
ideological subversion goals of the kgb is there truth to that kind of
those ideas yes but um you know i
i think i already sort of mentioned that i think bessmanov was a fraud and i have i have again can you
elaborate good arguments let's put it this way uh first of all uh we we know that uh
the kgb was involved in active measures which is you know um
you can call it uh uh fake news yeah uh seeding fake news into
the advert in the countries that are your adversaries and and the russians have been doing
this lately by meddling in our election and and focusing on the left and the right
fringe and influencing them to become more left and no more right so that and
uh and vasily mctoken uh has and as in in one of his books uh he
has a whole chapter about active measures okay so what he has to say about the
department and i forgot what department that was was the one department that was the least desirable
for kgb agents because these were desk jobs for people who had to come up with
fake stories in countries where they didn't quite know
too much about the country now there were some successes like one of them
the two uh most famous successes uh that i'm aware of is that uh uh the canard that the eighth virus was
concocted in a cia lab and so a lot of people around the world
believe that and the other one was that uh j edgar hoover was a secret
cross-dresser cross-dresser that was that that is still known by a
lot of americans who are of a certain age that this was the truth but uh mitrokin actually traces it back to
a story that was placed in a sort of left wing but close to mainstream uh french magazine
and it was then taken taken up by uh more um you know
larger newspapers and and well-established papers so so they had some successes but this
kind of a massive well
thought out campaign to destabilize the united states i don't believe the kgb was
capable of doing that mitroken seems to agree with me i was trained i would think
you know i was one of the crown jewels of the agent one would think that they used the best
that they had to to help me how to become an american and they didn't have
a clue so how did they co if you don't know how a country operates how do you come up
with with this this this this kind of a very detailed uh long-term plan that's that's also
timed you know two years this and one year that and all that yeah so we should actually just clarify so
he has this whole idea that there's uh 15 to 20 years i need it for demoralization
where you're you're basically infiltrating a country
from a young or people from a young age manipulating their mind you're destabilizing them that's the second
step that takes two to five years you uh target the country's foreign relations defense and economy you create
a crisis artificially and then you normalize it as as if it uh always was this way so it's basically saying
that the kgb is capable of at scale uh over many years
manipulate an entire population of people right and this is kind of um
there's a lot of people that believe in conspiracy theories that are amenable to this kind of idea now my
own experience is that there is in fact just a giant amount of incompetence
and this is something that's actually very difficult to pull off because yes it's incredibly
um incredibly difficult to achieve this kind of manipulation i think it would it
would require first of all not much bureaucracy not
much slowing down you have to have incredible in the modern world digital systems are able to do surveillance
manipulation there has to be a strategy that is carried out in secrecy across a
huge number of people effectively that also requires you to hire the best people in the world
and i think it's difficult to execute on this kind of thing with the
if you com compartmentalize because there has to be great collaboration there has to be a great
work where there's a unified vision coordination and coordination across multiple groups
there has to be i mean there is it's very difficult to do now nevertheless especially with technology
this becomes easier and easier so the bar comes lower and lower to achieve
mass surveillance becomes easier and easier and easier uh mass manipulation through platforms because we're now
digitally connected you can now do that kind of manipulation so it becomes more and more realistic that you could do
this kind of thing but you're saying that no intelligence first
of all intelligence is hard and to do it at scale and to do it well
and to do it in a way that it's also not just collecting information about
the populace but manipulating the populace is very very difficult right now let me now give you an another
argument why i think that besmanov was a fraud uh i mean i already have i i have
uh uh matrookin on my side and and my personal observation of uh the
incompetence that uh that i witnessed i mean they really really didn't know what they
didn't know so now basmanov was kgb where was he stationed
in india he he was a low-level
agent in india and i told you with the one thing that the kgb was really good was
that it was compartmentalization how does bezn bismanov in india find out about this massive plan that should have
been super secret right he made it up sorry yeah and and you
know why he got away with it because americans eat that up because it's not our fault it's like the damn russians that don't
do doing all that that bad stuff speaking of the damn russians doing all that bad stuff
you know about the internet research agency they have been doing quite a bit of
damage and uh i i'm now familiar with the world of uh
enhanced artificial persons these are the avatars on facebook and twitter and you know
so forth that uh look like real people and uh and uh and there are quite a few
of them and and i have a good friend who operates in in that realm and uh you know he he uses for instance
facial recognition when he uh uh thinks that
there's a suspicious character say on linkedin or or on facebook and very often he finds out yeah that
that person exists but it's not the person who uh it pretends to be
so basically detecting the artificial yes the enhanced artificial yes but but he can also make them
you think the united stand in hand yeah the united states doesn't do it we do it too but uh well this is to push back
against your pushback right yeah bezel might be a fraud
but is it possible especially in the modern age that there is these kind of large-scale systematic operator wouldn't
you as a government more so
uh that's investing billions of dollars into military
equipment in in a world that's more and more clearly going to be
defined by uh cyber war versus hot war right wouldn't you
start to have serious meetings large amounts of hires that are working at how do we manipulate
the information flow how do we manipulate the minds of the populace how do we sell them a narrative
so even though he might have been making up a story because people eat it up
could it speak to some deep truth that's actually different than the the truth you came up
in as a kgb agent oh i agree with you 100 is much easier when uh you know all
you need is is an army of nerds who also know that's
no fantastic that's a term of endearment yes i love nerds
i i used to be one myself but anyway i was a nerd so you know
um so what i was going to say here is all you need is an army of nerds and and
what but also uh experts in the culture of the target
country okay and and nowadays the world is different there's a whole lot more
fluidity there's a whole lot of more people that like say russians for instance study in the united states chinese an army of chinese studying in
the united states they they have a lot more knowledge of how we function than the kgb did
and it's vice versa uh not as many americans in in russia but we have some
but in the the chinese and the russians have an advantage here okay ask your question based on your
experience so i have been talking to a lot of powerful people
and some of which have uh very close connections to in this particular
conflict uh ukraine and russia but in other places as well i don't believe i've ever been contacted
by or interacted with an intelligence agency cia fsb
mi6 assad i don't think i have well
let me say explicitly i haven't had an official conversation which is what i assume i would have
because i have nothing to hide right so i think there's no reason for people to be secretive
but what i why why is that what i know
am i interesting at all how how are people determined if they're in person of interest or not and i guess the
question i mean some of it i asked in a bit of a humorous way but also perhaps
there's truth in some of the humors would i know if i have ever interacted
with the intelligence agency spy
well you you don't know that you haven't been contacted uh but you um but
certainly not uh i think you you never had a conversation that uh related to intelligence in any
way shape or form right right like where a person another person introduced yeah and just themselves or
you know becomes sort of wants to be your friend and then uh talks about these types of topics
right yeah but i [Laughter] um
there's people because because of who i'm interacting with they're
i mean even just even with elon musk like if you think about elon musk there's a lot of people that
are um that are part of the conversations that
happen how do i know they're all trustworthy they all present themselves as trustworthy now again i have nothing
so this is this is for the intelligence agencies i have nothing to hide i am the same person privately as publicly
well-intentioned uh real no no controlled no weird sexual stuff
where you can manipulate me um what else no drug use no drug use no
no skeletons in the closet um none of that kind of stuff but you
know i don't i don't know i mean just even having these conversations you know
i tend to trust people as a default like me too and
you start when you think well especially with some of the people i've
been talking with and some of the traveling i'm doing i'm realizing there's a
you know there's hard men in this world there's military there's serious
suffering and there's war and there's serious people that are
doing serious harm and so you have to be careful of thinking who to trust was
when the person approaches you with a smile and asks you a question my my
natural inclination is that person is a cool person i'll answer the question become a friend but it becomes difficult
when you realize that there's um there's things like intelligence agencies with thousands of employees
there's people that are doing major military actions that involve tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of
soldiers this is serious stuff and so how do i how do you know how to operate in this world the folks that you're
interacting with uh have a responsibility not to tell you
what they shouldn't tell you right right so and most of them probably won't and and i'm guessing occasionally they
will say well i can't go there right yeah so so what what
what you are uh aware of is sort of public
and what you're doing is you you uh you're collecting it and you
um you editing it to some extent you're not you're not changing the word the verbage
yes you you just uh repeat what they say so from that angle
you're not you're not privy to any real secrets what you uh
have possibly that could be of use is you learn to get to know the person
so i'm thinking there's a good possibility if you get the interviews
uh in in the east that somebody may actually approach you and ask you what's what's your opinion i just hope they
approach me and introduce themselves properly i i just yeah there's a kind of
i mean would you know like how many uh russian spies are there in the united states how many american spies are there
in russia do you have a sense is it no idea just like with the gru no idea
is it is it possible there is like tens of thousands and we're not or like thousands not not thousands like i used
to operate we were too hard to train and we weren't that successful to begin with but
particularly russians and chinese you know both
governments know who is going abroad and
i guarantee you there's a lot of amateur spies they they're they're being asked you know help us out you know do
something for the motherland and crowdsource spying yeah sort of not not seriously training
but yeah and yeah for instance uh this this lady uh i forgot her first first name boutina she was a rank amateur she
used social media to communicate with moscow uh so she had no training but she was
reasonably successful i mean she uh and and and uh um
i the difference between let's say uh the current russian intelligence and the
kgb vladimir putin and his uh his henchmen uh are okay with
people being caught because and every time i i go and talk and give a talk someplace i'm always
asked this question honey i mean how many russian spies do you think we have here because that it scares the
people right and putin likes to scare people the kgb was very solicitous of uh
of their agents they were you know they uh they didn't want any one of them caught all right so that's that's a big
difference and uh you know so getting caught so for the fsb getting caught sends a strong signal to the world that
there's yeah there could be many more and there probably are but
and uh because also the world again there's a
whole lot more travel going on a whole lot more interaction studying abroad doing business
and uh you know there's there will be attempted espionage probably one
every minute in this country that doesn't mean they will be successful no uh
uh but uh there is a a cottage industry now that is doing quite well that teaches
companies how to uh you know fortify themselves against like
industrial espionage or also foreign actors spying
it's all over the place yeah as it becomes easier and easier with digital yes with cyber yes it becomes a serious
and very serious threat we might wind up in a world where nobody knows anymore what's up and
what's down if i was to have a conversation with vladimir putin
and or vladimir zelinski is there something you would ask
about the time in the kgb the time in his past
we are all of us men and women are creations of the experiences we have
throughout life early on in life and through the formative experiences successes and failures so uh yeah you
you just said the key words you know i would ask you know without giving away anything you know just being high level
your biggest success and your biggest failure as a politician or
in the realm of uh uh kgb when the wall came down and uh
he was in in an office kgb office in the city of dresden
and um these germans were uh besieging uh stasi offices and they also
dropped by the kgb office and uh they they were it was pretty threatening it looked like
they won't actually storm the office and get you know the documents and stuff like that
and uh um initially then the first demonstration uh was uh
um um was told that uh if if they come any
closer weapons would be used so they disappeared and then they came back and uh and
i don't know some somebody in that office called berlin and said what are we going to do can are we allowed to use
force and the answer came back that gorbachev said absolutely not
and so this is where putin all of a sudden you know he was at one point a member of the
greatest the most powerful intelligence organization in the world and all of a sudden he was powerless
and he had to watch how you know this this was a defeat big
one and and it's a supposedly a powerful
intelligence agency cowering yeah sort of crawling back into a position of
weakness and he probably promised himself never again russia needs to be great again
the kgb fsb russia the russian empire
needs to rise again and that there's a feeling for him that that's as he talks about the collapse of the soviet union
being a great tragedy there's a feeling like that was uh
um that was like never again yeah and and i i believe that uh he has
a he has a strong conviction uh that
i don't know if he's religious he carries across now but i don't know what that means but and somehow but that uh
it's the destiny of the russian nation to be great and that that is sort of that that's
whether there's it's it's determined by god or some some higher power that that is very important for him of course that
nationalist idea is uh one that americans share as well and
you know it could uh help a nation flourish so by itself it's not necessarily a bad thing
oh it's how it manifests itself as a question um well one other thing is
if i were to uh get a chat with the ukrainian uh
president i would ask him how many lives
what what what what is the equation between giving up some land and how many lives
uh are worth this land and that's a it's a good way to phrase
the question of course that question gets you killed in ukraine but uh because there's another part of
that equation which is it's not just land versus lives it's
the sovereignty the the knowledge that you're free and yourself determined
and like it's not about like fighting for the particular land it's saying
we are messed up corrupt uh
we have problems it's a messy world but it's our world
uh i think stephen crane has a poem about like a man eating his own heart
and he was asked uh how does it taste and he said it's bitter but i like it because it is
bitter and because it is my heart and that there's a sense of like i want this is
not just about land this is our nation uh the same love of nation that uh putin
has for russia the greater russia this vision of this great empire uh i believe ukraine does as well there
not every nate you know there's levels to this game and ukrainian people are some of the proudest people
throughout the history of the 20th century throughout the history of earth the polish people are proud people
you could just see in world war ii the people who said you
you're not having this we will die to the last man though there's different cultures that kind of
really hold their ground and ukrainian people are that you know i have to admit in that respect i'm a
uh i'm a bit of a coward i i could not do what zielinski has been doing
uh i uh um i would sort of
try try to find a way to carve out something that
i i can live with however if if
that force that evil force ghost gets to my family right there's lines
yes that's that's right you're you become the world's bravest man as
somebody across that line oh yeah you mentioned something about you've not
been to moscow back and that you it might not be safe for you to travel there
yes um can you speak to the nature of that
you know as somebody somebody that successfully got out of the kgb
how are you still alive a number of reasons um first of all um
when my story became public that was six years ago i was pretty old right and so
uh the folks that may have a personal interest or may have had a personal interest in doing me harm
most of them don't live anymore all right that's number one number two i i did not
uh i wasn't a hired hand a german i did not betray the motherland that's a crime
that just uh punished by death you betray the motherland that's
uh and um and
and the other thing is um if there is a you know that these kinds
of operations to assassination on a in another country are very difficult to
plan and implement and if there's a list of people that they don't like i
may not be at the very top having said that you know if i wind up saying moscow or even in
countries like turkey where there's a lot of lawlessness you know accidents
can easily be uh arranged and that's just sending another message you know
just like you know we we we can do a lot of things powerful yes
do you think it's safe for me to travel in russia and ukraine um
i think you uh you know very well how to communicate in both countries you
know you've shown this in this interaction that uh uh
you have a lot of empathy for the people you'll be talking with and empathy means good understanding where they're coming
from and then there are lines that you can't cross yeah like the question that i was
going to ask zelinski who not going to ask good for you yeah isn't that the funny thing about
this world there's lines there's lines everywhere even in love even in personal relationships there's lines you should
not cross yeah how did you finally get caught i resigned
in 1988. so let's actually talk about that there's a okay resigned
there's there's warning signs there's another yet another choice yet another crossroads yes okay what was the
calculation what was the choice to be made to um give a little background and it
was it was 1988 and i i was i thought
they would my uh my time in the us would soon end
because you know i thought 10 to 12 years it was already past 10 years there
was no indication that they that they indicated you know that they said you know you know we're done you're
done but in december of 1988 i got this one
one thing that i never wanted to see so we had a system of signals
that uh either one of those diplomat agents could set
at a spot that i passed by every day or i could set where they would pass by
uh like on their way from where they live to the united nations for instance who would just drive
so and and mine was uh my the signal spot uh for me was
on a on a support beam for the elevated atrian and in queens
and it was uh morning in december that i walked by there and routinely look at it and i
never expected anything and there was this red dot it was about the size of my fist with a you know red paint
and uh you know since you have done it already i can i think i can curse in this
moment because it's the only way i can really indicate how i felt i said oh
because that was the danger signal yes there was like you must you are in
severe danger of uh and you you need to get out of the country as soon as possible there was a
a protocol that i was supposed to follow i wasn't even supposed to go home i just needed to was supposed to get my
my reserve documents that i had hidden in a park in
in the bronx and made make a beeline to to the canadian border i wasn't ready
so i just like ignored this thing i mean i did i couldn't ignore it but i went on to work
got on the a train get went to work and then went to my cubicle and stared
at the computer screen all day because i couldn't think i could think only about what to do what to do what to do the
reason for this indecisiveness was that i was a father at the time i was
my my little girl by the name of chelsea was 18 months old and
i was there when she was born i took her to
tour the home i watched her grow up i watched her take the first steps
and always look at me with these big eyes lovingly look at me and
that is when i started my re-entry into the human race
because i just fell in love with this girl that's when love came back
and it was completely unexpected and there's a lot of fathers who
understand you particularly fathers of girls who understand what happened there
and i still thought i need to go back because you know there was
there was probably some danger but i hadn't figured out how to take care of the girl you know
and leave her but you know maybe she need to she need to have a good life and grow up and and have a chance and
her mother had a she was from south america she had a fourth grade education
that would have not worked very well so i played for time i
obviously i could be sick i couldn't you know i could be in a hospital there was a
precedent where i was sick where i couldn't communicate for about three weeks so
i just did nothing um that was on a monday on a thursday
was my regular shortwave transmission i listened and they explained a little
in in in a few sentences we have reason to believe that the fbi is on your case
you need to execute the emergency procedure come home right away
i still had some time because the radio could be broken or the transmission was bad or he still could
be in a hospital right so uh i gave myself some more time
and then something happened where
they forced my hand it's the only time that the soviet agent was anywhere near me
on the territory of the united states so i'm waiting for the a train on a
on a dark morning still in uh in queens and
there's this uh man the short man in a black trench coat
comes up to me from my right and he whispers into my ears you gotta come back
or else you're dead i can't imitate the russian accent there was a russian accent so
now and it was a pretty strong accent the you're dead phrase
can have two meanings and an american would have said or else you're busted or else you get
arrested or else you're dead it's very strong so now you have to have to take it
seriously to some degree because i know that uh they didn't they had a history of uh
assassinating or at least trying to assassinate the factor so uh that that obviously raised the the
stakes a little bit uh but i i i just talked myself into believing this was just uh
a bad phrasing and but at this point i knew and they knew that we both knew
right so there was no more guessing he he found me he talked to me i know so now i had to act so in in the next
radiogram i was uh asked for uh to
execute a dead drop operation where they would give me money and
a passport and that was in a park in on staten
island it was a location that i found and i described and and i was always uh
praised for my my ability to describe spots that are easy to find
so that what that was a given so and the only thing that was different in
this for this operation they they scheduled it for the dark all right so but
it was still no problem because it was in a park and then a couple of um about
uh 100 yards in uh by uh next to a a fallen
tree it would be hard to miss so i go to staten island and i read the
signal that uh said uh i i put the container in the drop
that that was the protocol there's a signal that the person who
uh who hands over with something puts at a spot not too far from the spot
itself that means i would go in and just pick it up the reason i actually
went to pick up this container because there was money in it so i didn't have to make
a decision yet okay i could throw away the passport i it was like i was still trying to figure
out what to do what to do what to do so i get to the spot i get to the tree uh and i
had a flashlight with me that the park there was nowhere in the park and it was even during the day though this park was
not uh it was more almost like a little forest uh and uh
i don't see the container it wasn't supposed to be a crushed oil can
pretty sizable nothing hard to miss and i do a double take and i look again
and i look around and look around a little more see if they misplaced it i can't find it
that's the only one that one of those operations failed
and that just doesn't make a lot of sense so when as i'm walking away from this
like sort of emotionally
i said to myself i'm staying yeah that decision kind of signals some kind
of muse just spoke to you that decision
was made for me now you know that i'm a christian now and i think that was like god told me this
you know but it was certain there it was right there that was it that was it that was
it and uh so what i did uh uh to uh well first of all i
divine into intervention helped me to find find a good explanation i sent him my last letter
and with secret writing i uh i communicated to them i said i
i wish i could come but i can't because i have contracted hiv aids
that was the best lie ever because nobody wanted to have aids in their
country those days it was a death sentence right yes and i knew i had we had conversations
when i was back in moscow how they were snickering about what's going on in the united states you know that that
depraved culture and you see when they they're killing each other and the debrief culture took you took over your
being and yes no and and and i was and i was convincing enough i'd even traced it
back to a girlfriend i had once that i had actually reported on that she you know i
i interacted with this lady who had a boyfriend at one point who was a drug addict and
she was infected and she infected me so they believed it they sent and i asked
him to give my my dollar savings to my german family uh
they gave them some but they they told they told my family that i
already passed away that i'm dead they believed it 100 and i guess the agent who
took the money took half of it for himself so that was it and uh in the next three
months i made sure that i wasn't uh reliably
at the same spot in the same time frame so i went to work in different
paths at different times just to you know you know just doing this
safety measure so to speak and not not not huge uh but you know i did it
it kept me kept my allowed me to keep my sanity uh and and obviously after i
sent the letter i i threw the shortwave radio in the hudson river destroyed the one-time pads that i still
had so i was now uh ready to uh for a new life for a
new life and live out my life as an american undiscovered uh but you know
starting to work on my version of the american dream
and the first action was was telling my wife the mother of this
child you know she always wanted to have a house and say you know
what we should buy a house and a year later we moved into the suburbs and then i said we should have
another child and we had another child so and i had a career where i did pretty
well uh i moved a couple of times wound up in a mech
mansion but before that my second house was actually in pennsylvania in rural pennsylvania and
this is where uh i was discovered by the fbi
and how did they know about me uh i if if it if it hadn't been for this
defector vasily mitrokin who was an archivist in in the kgb archives
he was actually pretty high level he was in charge of the relocation of the archive from
lu lubyanka to yasinovo
and he really hated the he had reason to believe he hated the
soviet system uh i i think i remember that his son was
quite ill and he could have gotten treatment in england and he was not allowed to to travel to england with his son so
he uh his hatred he tried to figure out what to do and how to do damage to that
system so he started copying notes little little slips of paper
handwritten that he smuggled out in his underwear and in socks over the years
and then he transcribed them with the typewriter and then put the
pieces of paper uh and into some kind of a container and and and and
buried this in his stature it was i believe in 1992
when he showed up that was already the the soviet union was gone so he showed up at the u.s embassy in
moscow and told him what he had and it was on a weekend and apparently there was a junior person in charge and he
said you know what what you got we're not interested in it's really old
uh that's a career limiting move right uh because then uh vasily mitrokin then uh made its way to
one of the baltic republics and uh contacted mi
six and they said come on in old fellow have a cup of tea
and so they they managed to get this stuff out of the dacha and uh and get it to england and eventually
uh the mi6 shared it with the fbi and uh there wasn't a whole lot of information
about me it was very very little it was like there's an uh a person by the name of jack barsky who
isn't illegal operating in the northeast of the united states now if it was jim miller they
wouldn't have found me jack barsky was easy to find so they checked social security and jack
barsky was had gotten his social security card at the age of 33
bingo okay the all they knew though was that i wasn't illegal that i was still living
there they didn't know whether i was active inactive uh they and the other thing that they
knew that i was a really really well-trained agent because i was still there right
so um they took i think almost three years to
investigate me watch me from a distance because you know if i was still active i would would have found out that
somebody's investigating here so you started being less and less active in terms of uh oh i
stopped completely what i mean is oh surveillance detect remote yes after three months i stopped all
together okay yeah good point and fbi is still very careful they were very
careful they they pretty much watched me and then and at one point i had a house in the country with one
neighbor at one point that house was for sale so the fbi bought it and they put a couple of agents there
and just keep a closer eye on me there was no
indication that uh i was still active but they were still cautious
and but at one point they they were able to plant a bug in my
kitchen a listening device and i
my wife and i didn't get along very well you know there was a lot of friction and she was constantly complaining about things and
you know i got sick and tired of it and one day we had an argument in the kitchen
and then i i chose to deploy the nuclear option
[Laughter] and that is that is telling her what i sacrificed to be with her to so
she would understand that i am there on her side yeah i'm supporting her something doesn't quite
fit it is not because i don't love the both of them chelsea and penelope
so i when i said that the listening device was active so the fbi was
hearing my confession i was once a kgb agent blah blah blah blah and and i quit because
uh then because of uh and then state state here because of you and chelsea
and um that also made it clear to the fbi that i wasn't
active anymore so they had both of that so now uh they knew
an attempt to turn me would have been useless because you know because you know you turned somebody was
active but they figured they had there was enough reason to treat me
nicely because they figured that i had a lot of information that
was as as aged as it was but it was still important for the fbi to get to know
and so one day uh there was a friday
evening i i i'm driving back home from the office
and i'm being stopped by a um state uh state
state police and as i'm going through the toll
uh oh that it's a bridge over the hudson and they had to pay a toll and he waved me he got me right
where i stopped and he said could you please uh move over here it's a routine traffic stop and i thought nothing of it i had
forgotten at that point that i once was a spy you know it was like this was gone
and uh and then he said no could you sleep please step out of the car that should have uh aroused my suspicion that's
unusual right routine traffic stop uh yeah i did it no problem and then
again somebody came from the right came on into my view and he flipped this uh
id and they said fbi we would like to have a talk with you now this is uh my now friend joe riley
who who actually is the uh he's the godfather of my of trinity my last child but anyway
uh he told me later that uh when when i heard that phrase
all the blood left my face it became totally white uh
but i recovered very quickly and he said it himself so uh you know he they took me to
a vehicle and uh there was an another agent in the vehicle and he had a gun strapped to
his ankle so that was pretty real first question i had so am i under
arrest and the answer was no and then my instinct kicked in
uh in my ability to to operate in very well under high pressure situations
and i asked them so what took you so long you know
the intent of that was to um to uh
de diffuse any kind of tension yes and i saw a smile
instant friends uh yeah i i knew i knew that uh i had to make them
like me and i'm i think by now i know i'm a pretty pretty likable person so i would say so
so so uh and i uh when when they took me to a motel which they had rented uh
there was an uh the two two uh wings at a right angle they they had one
they bought all the rooms in one wing and they had a guard at each end of
that wing and they took me in the middle and there were some props there
some binders with labels and i immediately thought now this is pretty
silly because what what i know but i noticed that the the labels all referred back to my early
years i knew that they didn't know much else so um i told joe that afterwards and
that was not a great idea but anyway [Laughter] uh but but i volunteered i made the
following statement before we even started the the uh interview i said i know there's only one way for me to and
my family to have a chance to get through here without much damages if i'm if i'm
completely 100 cooperative and this is my intent to do
exactly that all right so we spent about two hours in the interview they allowed me to call my
wife tell her that i'm going to be late that that indicated to me already that they would let me go and after two hours they
let me go um but they had the area
covered with a whole bunch of people and the head of that that team
talked to me and said if you think of running we got every intersection in this area
covered you can't i didn't say anything but you know i had no no thought of running
so and that was the beginning of uh another phase of my life where i was on
cooperating with the fbi for quite a while and living still undercover for several years until i had real good
documentation and became an american citizen uh seven years ago
uh today seven years ago so recently uh yeah wow quite recent the bureaucracy
took a long time to figure out how to how to make me real and
and also not put me in in in this witness protection program you know to keep my name
and then just you know make everything like official so for instance
i had to change my birth year uh simply because if i
jack barsky was born in 1944 if i kept 1944 the fbi would have helped me commit
a crime because i would have uh collected social security of uh four years or sooner
so and anyway uh details of that yes it took quite a while and when i finally
got the call from the office uh of homeland security uh since uh
the lady says uh this is agent so and so uh uh from
homeland security can you come to the office tomorrow and uh
i said um let me look at my calendar and then i said wait a minute what am i
talking about what time do you want me to be there because i had waited for that moment for a long time and i was
sworn in right then and there uh it was a good feeling to walk out of there because i
i had a country again you know and i love this country just as much as you said you love it uh
with all its warts and its problems that we're going through right now um and
then the last thing that changed my life again and i don't want to get into details because it's a little
complicated story i never wanted to be a public person and then
i was discovered through a number of uh dots that were unlikely to be connected
it had to do with a relative with with a half brother of my wife who lives
in germany was taken to to germany by his mother
who came to visit somebody not us but that somebody that he came to visit
lived 50 miles from our house and that my my wife and and this half
brother never never met in person before they knew about each other to social media
and when he found out my background he he was a conductor who was a german railroad at
the time he said oh this is a big story and one that's gonna be big big big
okay well he happened to know this one person who happened happened to know
one of the star reporters of der spiegel and after she
did some research and determined that i was real she was on my case and she happened to
know uh steve croft the guy guy from 60 minutes you see all these connections i
had nothing to do with it that's how life works dots get connected somehow sometimes yeah most of us it does stuff
happens you get lucky you you don't know lucky a few times in your life but yeah
i think i'm must be part irish too [Laughter] yeah so uh
it's uh it's been it's been an interesting ride um
i'm just still shaking my head about all the stuff that happened oh it's been a fun
one what you wrote uh because i'm allowed to leave behind a documented legacy of my
unusual life yeah i'm praying that the legacy will be described by a single
word love so let us return to the thing we started the conversation with which is love yeah
what role does love play in this human condition in your life and yeah in
our life here together i i give you an answer
by telling you what happened one day i i gave a presentation at microsoft
headquarters that's a strange beginning a long story but yes
no that's not a love story and so there's this there's this young this beautiful young lady sitting in the back
and she's she's paying a lot of attention uh found out later that uh her
her job at microsoft job job title was storyteller
it's soft marketing right yeah you could say that yeah but but
that's if you can't afford somebody like that that's that's good anyway
she uh questioned and answered she raised her hand and she asked me
so all the things that you have done and you've experienced what's the
number one lesson you've taken away from from your life that was a new question for me i've
never never been asked that question and i i thought about about it for 20 seconds and then i came
up with this uh this phrase that we all know love conquers all
because in my life it did in the end and uh
and it's uh it's the strongest human emotion and that is what makes us human
really and he spoke about the i mean offline as i've spoken with you
it's it's clear to me how transformative how powerful the life of
your children are your daughters in your life and who you are and
why you think life is beautiful and why you think this country is beautiful now that um
that i'm pretty mature to put it mildly uh
i'm i'm also more loving towards many more people
you know these things like random acts of kindness for strangers i do them i'm looking for them now and you
know what it's good for me well welcome to texas because this
random kind acts of kindness a stranger seems to be a way of life
which is one of the reasons i love it here um it just reminds me why i love
human beings which is that they there's just this warmth this conduction yeah and and georgia is the same thing yeah
amen um do you have any regrets do you yeah looking back at life do you wish
you've done something different well i like i could have but i
then i would have had it would have a different regret i betrayed the wife the german wife that
i loved i really did love her and i betrayed her
but if i don't betray her then i
i betray the child that is a source of so much love for you now so maybe your life is a kind of
um you get to choose your regrets
it's a it's a little bit uh of a strange way of putting it but i there's no other
choice uh and i tell you what what i don't regret and and that's that may be
you probably understand it now because you have enough background about me i don't regret having lied to my mother
because i had no really strong emotional relationship with her she took care of me
she was proud of me but we didn't hug we didn't did we didn't interact emotionally
whatsoever so you don't feel like you betrayed that i love that that uh well i i did i know
that i know that she she was looking for me until she the day she died she she wrote
a letter to president gorbachev asking him for help to locate me
she she checked with the stasi she just was
like hell-bent on finding me and couldn't find me so she passed away without
knowing what happened to me now there was this uh this rumor that uh
was flying around and she possibly may have bought into that rumor because my cover for
uh when i went to the united states was that i uh changed careers again and i joined uh
a um an institution in kazakhstan that did uh space research
intercosmos something something and i had an i had a piece of paper that
one that invited me to start there and that was theo it was a forgery the intercosmos didn't never existed but but
people knew that in kazakhstan there were super secret uh in
facilities so and some one of my classmates old classmates from high
school started the rumor that i died in a rocket accident
and everybody knew that so when i came back to germany
went back to germany i found the telephone number of this
girl that had dumped me i called her and i said i said also so guess who this
is but maybe you hold on to your chair she says yes i said this is albrecht
it's a good payback no we actually met so there's two elderly people in their 60s
uh who meet each other after so many years and
the one that ended the relationship started the conversation by saying
you know what i made a really bad mistake and and the tears came down her cheeks i
wasn't asking for that i wouldn't i wasn't happy about it but it did feel good now now uh uh a while later uh
i knew why she said she made a mistake i met her husband
yeah i mean there's uh this there's a town waist has a song called martha where you make
um or an older gentleman calls somebody he used to love and they have a conversation they're both married now
and it's sometimes you can meet people from your past and it gives you a glimpse of a
possible different life you could have had oh yeah uh and you know i was actually when she said i made a mistake
and i was thinking to myself no you didn't there was none there was nothing left
there was nothing left uh and also the person that you became uh
personality-wise wasn't as as attractive as as i remembered her you know it's puppy love
you know but it's still love yeah it was happened it was a passionate love for sure and uh
i i would have uh i would have thrown myself under the bus if i could save her
it was that strong and just as strong as the love for my two girls yeah
life is full of moments and periods like that of love and then that's what makes life so so
freaking awesome but it does come to an end and so does this conversation i guess
no this goes on for many more hours but yes uh do you think about your own death huh do you think about death do you
think about your own death yes are you afraid of it yes
even though i'm a christian um
as a christian you have a sense what's coming after or is it full of uncertainty i have a hope
i have a hope uh you know um [Music] there there's a lot of uh there's a lot
of christianity which is quite logical a lot of christianity which is also uh
you know the life of christ there's a lot of a lot of proof uh but you know
and i became a christian uh starting
with a head and and and i was already
quite old and i uh uh
you know when you don't when you don't get this faith very early
uh it's it's it's tougher to buy into everything you know there are some there's some things
that are difficult for me to understand and and believe but but there's many many other things that
i can't explain only with the existence of a god but whether he lets us go
again for an eternity i just hope
i won't convince somebody else at this point which is doesn't make me a really really good questioning because
i'm supposed to evangelize but there's still a fear yeah there's a fear and a hope
uh on the other hand uh i know that you see see this this is this is how i
approach the the last years of my life uh
i will not i will not mentally or physically
get decrepit i will do everything i can do to be
alert and fit i still run i run four or five times a week
and i'm going to start lifting weights again good if you stay physically mentally sharp
yes go out with guns blazing that's that's and and i once read a book written by a
by a medical doctor he said most people uh uh
when when when when they're becoming mature that the the rest of their life
is a slow downward move and [Music]
not for you no the last years are pretty bad he said you got to do this boom
that's that's pretty good advice from a doctor um and if nothing else from christianity
uh whichever parts you take on one of the big ones is love yeah and that's something you've lived from the very
beginning before yes before god was part of your life before anything was part of your life it seemed
that love was part of your life and has been a consistent thread throughout yes sir and uh uh
there's there's a short sentence in in the bible it says god is love
and and the other thing is i want to say that the christian morality is
is i'm i i can sign that with my blood okay god is love amen jack you're an
incredible person have lived an incredible life
thank you for talking today thank you for telling your story uh thank you for being who you are and
thank you for being um all about love this is a this is a beautiful conversation it was an honor
thank you and uh appreciate the tough questions that you asked thanks for listening to this
