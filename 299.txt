the following is a conversation with demus hasabis ceo and co-founder of deepmind
a company that has published and builds some of the most incredible artificial intelligence systems in the history of
computing including alfred zero that learned all by itself to play the game of gold
better than any human in the world and alpha fold two that solved protein
folding both tasks considered nearly impossible for a very long time
demus is widely considered to be one of the most brilliant and impactful humans in the history of artificial
intelligence and science and engineering in general this was truly an honor and a pleasure
for me to finally sit down with him for this conversation and i'm sure we will talk many times again in the future
this is the lex friedman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends
here's demis hassabis let's start with a bit of a personal question
am i an ai program you wrote to interview people until i get good enough to interview you
well i'll be impressed if if you were i'd be impressed by myself if you were i don't think we're quite up to that yet
but uh maybe you're from the future lex if you did would you tell me is that is that a good thing to tell a language
model that's tasked with interviewing that it is in fact um ai maybe we're in
a kind of meta turing test uh probably probably it would be a good idea not to tell you so it doesn't change your
behavior right this is a kind of heisenberg uncertainty principle situation if i told you you behave differently yeah maybe that's what's
happening with us of course this is a benchmark from the future where they replay 2022 as a year before ais were
good enough yet and now we want to see is it going to pass exactly
if i was such a program would you be able to tell do you think so to the touring test question
you've talked about the benchmark for solving intelligence
what would be the impressive thing you've talked about winning a nobel prize in a system winning a nobel prize
but i still return to the touring test as a compelling test the spirit of the touring test is a compelling test
yeah the turing test of course it's been unbelievably influential and turing's one of my all-time heroes but i think if
you look back at the 1950 papers original paper and read the original you'll see i don't think he meant it to
be a rigorous formal test i think it was more like a thought experiment almost a bit of philosophy he was writing if you
look at the style of the paper and you can see he didn't specify it very rigorously so for example he didn't
specify the knowledge that the expert or judge would have um not you know how
much time would they have to investigate this so these important parameters if you were gonna make it uh a true sort of
formal test um and you know some by some measures people claimed the turing test passed
several you know a decade ago i remember someone claiming that with a with a kind of very bog standard normal uh
logic model um because they pretended it was a it was a kid so the the judges
thought that the machine you know was was a was a child so um that would be
very different from an expert ai person uh interrogating a machine and knowing how it was built and so on so i think um
you know we should probably move away from that as a formal test and move more towards a general test where we test the
ai capabilities on a range of tasks and see if it reaches human level or above
performance on maybe thousands perhaps even millions of tasks eventually and cover the entire sort of cognitive space
so i think for its time it was an amazing thought experiment and also 1950s obviously it
was barely the dawn of the computer age so of course he only thought about text and now um we have a lot more different
inputs so yeah maybe the better thing to test is the generalizability so across
multiple tasks but i think it's also possible as as systems like god show
that eventually that might map right back to language so you might be able to demonstrate your ability to generalize
across tasks by then communicating your ability to generalize across tasks which is kind of
what we do through conversation anyway when we jump around ultimately what's in there in that
conversation is not just you moving around knowledge it's you moving around like these
entirely different modalities of understanding that ultimately map to
your ability to to uh operate successfully in all these domains which you can think of as tasks
yeah i think certainly we as humans use language as our main generalization communication tool so i think we end up
thinking in language and expressing our solutions in language um so it's going to be very powerful
uh uh mode in which to uh explain you know the system to explain what it's
doing um but i don't think it's the only uh uh modality that matters so i think
there's gonna be a lot of you know there's there's a lot of different ways to express uh capabilities uh other than
just language yeah visual robotics body language
um yeah action is the interactive aspect of all that that's all part of it but what's interesting with gato is that
it's a it's it's it's sort of pushing prediction to the maximum in terms of like you know mapping arbitrary
sequences to other sequences and sort of just predicting what's going to happen next so prediction seems to be
fundamental to intelligence and what you're predicting doesn't so much matter yeah it seems
like you can generalize that quite well so obviously language models predict the next word um gato predicts potentially
any uh action or any token uh and it's just the beginning really it's our most general agent one could call it so far
but um you know that itself can be scaled up massively more than we've done so far obviously we're in the in the
middle of doing that but the big part of solving agi is creating benchmarks that
help us get closer and closer sort of creating benchmarks that test the journalizability and it's just still
interesting that this fella alan turing was one of the first and probably still
one of the only people that was trying maybe philosophically but was trying to formulate a benchmark that could be
followed it is even though it's it's fuzzy it's still sufficiently rigorous to where you can
run that test and i still think something like the touring test will at the end of the day
be the thing that truly impresses other humans so that you can have a close friend
who's an ai system for that friend to be a good friend they're going to have to be able to
uh play starcraft and they're going to have to do all of these tasks um get you a beer so the
robotics tasks uh play games with you use language
humor all those kinds of things but that ultimately can boil down to language it feels like not in terms of the ai
community but in terms of the actual impact of general intelligence on the world it feels like language will be the
place where it truly shines i think so because it's such an important kind of input output for us i think you're right
i think the turing test that what the the kind of the the philosophy behind it which is the idea of can can a machine
mimic the behaviors of a human and men and i would say wider than just language
and text then you know in terms of actions and everything else creativity all these
things then um if it can sort of match or exceed human cognitive capabilities
then i think we have a you know true intelligence so i thought from that perspective you're right i think he did
formulate the right uh kind of uh setup i just i think there'll be a kind of
humor in the ai systems of the future looking back to this conversation
and thinking about the touring test and uh also thinking about
by that time they would know which year they were finally able to sort of cross the threshold of human level
intelligence and think how funny it is that we humans were still
confused about this whole problem that has been long ago been solved well hello to the ai agents of the
future anyway so going back to your to your journey when did you fall in love with programming first
well it's pretty uh pretty young age actually so um you know i started off uh actually games
was my first love so starting to play chess when i was around four years old and then um it was actually with
winnings from a chess competition that i managed to buy my first chess computer when i was about eight years old it was
a zx spectrum which was hugely popular in the uk at the time and uh it's amazing machine because i
think it trained a whole generation of programmers in the uk because it was so accessible you know you literally
switched it on and there was the basic prompt and you could just get going and um my parents didn't really know
anything about computers so but because it was my money from a chess competition i could i could say i i wanted to buy it
uh and then you know i just went to bookstores got books on programming and
um started typing in you know the programming code and and then of course um once you start doing that you start
adjusting it and then making your own games and that's when i fell in love with computers and realized that they were a very magical device um in a way i
kind of i would have been able to explain this at the time but i felt that they were sort of almost a magical extension of your mind i always had this
feeling and i've always loved this about computers that you can set them off doing something some task for you you
can go to sleep come back the next day and it's solved um you know that feels magical to me so
i mean all machines do that to some extent they all enhance our natural capabilities obviously cars make us
allow us to move faster than we can run but this was a machine to extend the mind
and and then of course ai is the ultimate expression of what a machine may be able to do or learn so
very naturally for me that thought extended into into ai quite quickly remember the the programming language
that was first started special to the machine no it was just the base it was just i think it was just
basic uh on the zx spectrum i don't know what specific form it was and then later on i got a commodore amiga which uh
was a fantastic machine no you're just showing off so yeah well lots of my friends had atari st's and i i managed
to get amigas it was a bit more powerful and uh and that was incredible and used to do um programming in assembler and
and uh also amos basic this this specific form of basic it was incredible actually as well all my coding skills
and when did you fall in love with ai so when did you first start to gain an understanding that you
can not just write programs that do some mathematical operations for you while you sleep but something that's
a keen to bringing an entity to life sort of
a thing that can figure out something more complicated than uh than a simple mathematical operation
yeah so there was a few stages for me all while i was very young so first of all as i was trying to improve at
playing chess i was captaining various england junior chess teams and at the time when i was about you know maybe 10 11 years old i was gonna become a
professional chess player that was my first thought um that dream was there sure she
tried to get to the highest level yeah so i was um you know i got to when i was about 12 years old i got to master stand
and i was second highest rated player in the world to judith polgar who obviously ended up being an amazing chess player
and uh world women's champion and when i was trying to improve at chess where you
know what you do is you obviously first of all you're trying to improve your own thinking processes so that leads you to
thinking about thinking how is your brain coming up with these ideas why is it making mistakes how can you how can
you improve that thought process but the second thing is that you it was just the beginning this was like in the in the
early 80s mid 80s of chess computers if you remember they were physical boards like the one we have in front of us and
you pressed down the you know the squares and i think kasparov had a branded version of it that i i i got and
um you were you know used to they're not as strong as they are today but they were they were pretty strong and you
used to practice against them um to try and improve your openings and other things and so i remember i think i
probably got my first one i was around 11 or 12. and i remember thinking um this is amazing you know how how has
someone programmed uh uh this this chess board to play chess uh and uh it was
very formative book i bought which was called the chess computer handbook by david levy which came out in 1984 or
something so i must have got it when i was about 11 12 and it explained fully how these chess programs were made i
remember my first ai program being uh programming my amiga it couldn't it
wasn't powerful enough to play chess i couldn't write a whole chess program but i wrote a program for it to play othello
reversey it's sometimes called i think in the u.s and so a slightly simpler game than chess but i used all of the
principles that chess programs had alpha beta search all of that and that was my first ai program i remember that very
well was around 12 years old so that that that brought me into ai and then the second part was later on uh when i
was around 1617 and i was writing games professionally designing games uh writing a game called theme park which
um had ai as a core gameplay component as part of the simulation um and it sold
you know millions of copies around the world and people loved the way that the ai even though it was relatively simple
by today's ai standards um was was reacting to the way you as the player played it so it was called a sandbox
game so it's one of the first types of games like that along with simcity and it meant that every game you played was
unique is there something you could say just on a small tangent about
really impressive ai from a game design human enjoyment perspective
really impressive ai that you've seen in games and maybe what does it take to create ai system and how hard of a
problem is that so a million questions just as a brief tangent
well look i think um games uh games have been significant in my life for three reasons so first of
all to to i was playing them and training myself on games when i was a kid then i went through a phase of
designing games and writing ai4 games so all the games i i professionally wrote uh had ai as a core component and that
was mostly in the in the 90s and the reason i was doing that in games industry was at the time the games
industry i think was the cutting edge of technology so whether it was graphics with people like john carmack and quake
and those kind of things or ai i think actually all the action was going on in
games and and we've seen we're still reaping the benefits of that even with things like gpus which you know i find
ironic was obviously invented for graphics computer graphics but then turns out to be amazingly useful for ai
it just turns out everything's a matrix multiplication it appears you know in the whole world so um so i think games at the time had
the most cutting edge ai and a lot of the the games uh uh we you know i was involved in writing so there was a game
called black and white which was one game i was involved with in the early stages of which i still think is the
most um impressive uh example of reinforcement learning in a computer game so in that
game you know you trained a little pet animal uh and yeah and it sort of learned from how you
were treating it so if you treated it badly then it became mean yeah and then it would be mean to to your villagers
and your and your population the sort of uh the little tribe that you were running uh but if you were kind to it
then it would be kind and people were fascinated by how that was and so was i to be honest with the way it kind of
developed and um especially the mapping to good and evil yeah it made you made you realize made me realize that you can
sort of in the way in the choices you make can define uh the
where you end up and that means all of us are capable of the good
uh evil it all matters in uh the different choices along the trajectory to those places that you make it's
fascinating i mean games can do that philosophically to you and it's rare it seems rare yeah well games are i think a
unique medium because um you as the player you're not just passively consuming the the entertainment right
you're actually actively involved as an as a as an agent so i think that's what makes it in some ways can be more
visceral than other other mediums like you know films and books so the second so that was you know designing ai and
games and then the third use uh uh i've we've used of ai is in deep mind from
the beginning which is using games as a testing ground for proving out ai
algorithms and developing ai algorithms and that was a that was a sort of um a core component of our vision at the
start of deepmind was that we would use games very heavily uh as our main testing ground certainly to begin with
um because it's super efficient to use games and also you know it's very easy to have metrics to see how well your
systems are improving and what direction your ideas are going in and whether you're making incremental improvements
and because those games are often rooted in something that humans did for a long time beforehand
there's already a strong set of rules like it's already a damn good benchmark yes it's really good for
so many reasons because you've got you've got you've got clear measures of how good humans can be at these things
and in some cases like go we've been playing it for thousands of years um and and uh often they have scores or at
least win conditions so it's very easy for reward learning systems to get a reward it's very easy to specify what
that reward is um and uh also at the end it's easy to you know to test uh
externally you know how strong is your system by of course playing against you know the world's
strongest players at those games so it's it's so good for so many reasons and it's also very efficient to run
potentially millions of simulations in parallel on the cloud so um i think
there's a huge reason why we were so successful back in you know starting out 2010 how come we were able to progress
so quickly because we'd utilize games and um you know at the beginning of deep
mind we also hired some amazing game engineers uh who i knew from my previous uh lives in the games industry and uh
and that helped to bootstrap us very quickly and plus it's somehow super compelling almost at a philosophical
level of man versus machine over over a chessboard or a go board
and especially given that the entire history of ai is defined by people saying it's going to be impossible to
make a machine that beats a human being in chess and then once that happened
people were certain when i was coming up in ai that go is not a game that could be solved
because of the combinatorial complexity it's just too it's it's it's you know
no matter how much moore's law you have compute is just never going to be able to crack the game of go yeah and so that
then there's something compelling about facing sort of taking on the impossibility of that task from the
ai researcher perspective engineer perspective and then as a human being
just observing this whole thing your beliefs about what you thought was
impossible being broken apart
it's it's uh humbling to realize we're not as smart as we thought it's humbling to realize that the things
we think are impossible now perhaps will be done in the future there's something
really powerful about a game ai system being a human being in a game that
drives that message uh home for like millions billions of people especially in the case of go sure
well look i think it's a i mean it has been a fascinating journey and and especially as i i think about it from i
can understand it from both sides both as the ai you know creators of the ai um but also
as a games player originally so you know it was a it was a really interesting it was i mean it was a fantastic um but
also somewhat bittersweet moment the alphago match for me um uh seeing that and and and being obviously heavily
heavily involved in that um but you know as you say chess has been uh the i mean
kasparov i think rightly called it the drosophila of of intelligence right so it's sort of i i love that phrase and
and i think he's right because chess has been um hand in hand with ai from the
beginning of the the whole field right so i think every ai practitioner starting with turing and claude shannon
and all those uh the sort of forefathers of of of of the field um tried their
hand at writing a chess program uh i've got original audition of claude shannon's first chess program i think it
was 1949 uh the the original sort of uh paper and um they all did that and
turing famously wrote a chess program that but all the computers around there were obviously too slow to run it so he
had to run he had to be the computer right so he literally i think spent two or three days running his own program by
hand with pencil and paper and playing playing a friend of his uh with his chess program so
of course deep blue was a huge moment uh beating off um but actually when that happened i
remember that very very vividly of course because it was you know chess and computers and ai all the things i loved
and i was at college at the time but i remember coming away from that being more impressed by kasparov's mind than i
was by deep blue because here was kasparov with his human mind not only could he play chess more or less to the
same level as this brute of a calculation machine um but of course kasparov can do everything else humans
can do ride a bike talk many languages do politics all the rest of the amazing things that kasparov does and so with
the same brain yeah and and yet deep blue uh brilliant as it was at chess it
had been hand coded for chess and um actually had distilled the knowledge of
chess grand masters uh into into a cool program but it couldn't do anything else like it couldn't even play a strictly
simpler game like tic-tac-toe so um something to me was missing from um
intelligence from that system that we would regard as intelligence and i think it was this idea of generality and and
also learning yeah um so and that's what we tried to do out with alphago yeah we
alphago and alpha zero mu zero and then got on all the things that uh we'll get
into some parts of there's just a fascinating trajectory here but let's just stick on chess briefly uh on the
human side of chess you've proposed that from a game design perspective the thing that makes chess
compelling as a game uh is that there's a creative tension between a bishop
and the knight can you explain this first of all it's really interesting to think about what
makes the game compelling makes it stick across centuries
yeah i was sort of thinking about this and actually a lot of even amazing chess players don't think about it necessarily from a games designer point of view so
it's with my game design hat on that i was thinking about this why is chess so compelling and i think a critical uh reason is the
the dynamicness of of of the different kind of chess positions you can have whether they're closed or open and other
things comes from the bishop and the night so if you think about how different the the the capabilities of
the bishop and knight are in terms of the way they move and then somehow chess has evolved to balance those two
capabilities more or less equally so they're both roughly worth three points each so you think that dynamics was
always there and then the rest of the rules are kind of trying to stabilize the game well maybe i mean it's sort of
i don't know his chicken and egg situation probably both came together but the fact that it's got to this beautiful equilibrium where you can have
the bishop and knight they're so different in power um but so equal in value across the set of the universe of
all positions right somehow they've been balanced by humanity over hundreds of years um i think gives gives the game
the creative tension uh that you can swap the bishop and knights uh for a bishop for a knight and you you they're
more or less worth the same but now you aim for a different type of position if you have the knight you want a closed position if you have the bishop you want
an open position so i think that creates a lot of the creative tension in chess so some kind of controlled creative
tension from an ai perspective do you think ai systems convention
design games that are optimally compelling to humans well that's an interesting question you
know sometimes i get asked about ai and creativity and and this and the way i answered that is relevant to that
question which is that i think they're different levels of creativity one could say so i think um if we define
creativity as coming up with something original right that's that's useful for a purpose then you know i think the kind
of lowest level of creativity is like an interpolation so an averaging of all the examples you see so maybe a very basic
ai system could say you could have that so you show it millions of pictures of cats and then you say give me an average
looking cat right generate me an average looking cat i would call that interpolation then there's extrapolation
which something like alphago showed so alphago played you know millions of games of go against itself
and then it came up with brilliant new ideas like move 37 in game two bringing a motif strategies and go that that no
humans had ever thought of even though we've played it for thousands of years and professionally for hundreds of years so that that i call that extrapolation
but then that's still there's still a level above that which is you know you could call out the box thinking or true
innovation which is could you invent go right could you invent chess and not just come up with a brilliant chess move
or brilliant go move but can you can you actually invent chess or something as good as chess or go and i think one day
uh ai could but what's missing is how would you even specify that task to a a
program right now and the way i would do it if i was best telling a human to do it or a games designer a human games
designer to do it is i would say something like go i would say um come up with a game that only takes five
minutes to learn which go does because it's got simple rules but many lifetimes to master right or impossible to master
in one lifetime because so deep and so complex um and then it's aesthetically beautiful uh and also uh it can be
completed in three or four hours of gameplay time which is you know useful for our us you know in in a human day
and so um you might specify these side of high level concepts like that and then you know with that and maybe a few
other things uh one could imagine that go satisfies uh those those constraints
um but the problem is is that we we're not able to specify abstract notions
like that high-level abstract notions like that yet to our ai systems um and i think there's still something missing
there in terms of um high-level concepts or abstractions that they truly understand and that you know combinable
and compositional um so for the moment i think ai is capable of doing
interpolation extrapolation but not true invention so coming up with rule sets
uh and optimizing with complicated objectives around those rule sets we can't currently do
but you could take a specific rule set and then run a kind of self-play
experiment to see how long just observe how an ai system from scratch learns how long is that journey
of learning and maybe if it satisfies some of those other things you mentioned in terms of quickness to learn and so on and you
could see a long journey to master for even an ai system then you could say that this is a promising game
um but it would be nice to do almost like alpha codes or programming rules so generating rules that kind of
uh that automate even that part of the generation of rules so i have thought about systems actually um that i think
would be amazing in in for a games designer if you could have a system that um takes your game plays it tens of
millions of times maybe overnight and then self balances the rules better so it tweaks the the rules and the maybe
the equations and the and the and the parameters so that the game uh is more
balanced the units in the game or some of the rules could be tweaked so it's a bit of like a giving a base set
and then allowing a monte carlo tree search or something like that to sort of explore it right and i think that would
be super super a powerful tool actually for for balancing auto balancing a game
which usually takes thousands of hours from hundreds of games human games testers normally to to
balance some one you know game like starcraft which is you know blizzard are amazing at balancing their games but it
takes them years and years and years so one could imagine at some point when this uh this stuff becomes uh efficient
enough to you know you might be able to do that like overnight do you think a game that is optimal
designed by an ai system would look very much like uh planet
earth maybe maybe it's only the sort of game i would love to make is is and i've tried
you know my in my game's career the games design career you know my first big game was designing a theme park an
amusement park then uh with games like republic i tried to you know have games where we designed whole cities and and
allowed you to play in so and of course people like will wright have written games like sim earth uh trying to
simulate the whole of earth pretty tricky but um i see earth i haven't actually played that one so what is it
does it incorporative evolution or yeah it has evolution and it's sort of um it tries to it sort of treats it as an
entire biosphere but from quite a high level so nice to be able to sort of zoom in zoom
out zoom in exactly so obviously he couldn't do that was in the night i think he wrote that in the 90s so it couldn't you know it wasn't it wasn't
able to do that but that that would be uh obviously the ultimate sandbox game of course on that topic do you think we're living
in a simulation yes well so okay so i'm gonna jump around from the absurdly philosophical
to the short term sure very very happy to so i think uh my answer to that question is a little bit complex because
uh there is simulation theory which obviously nick bostrom i think famously first proposed um
and uh i don't quite believe it in in that sense so um in the in the sense
that uh are we in some sort of computer game or have our descendants somehow recreated uh uh earth in the you know
21st century and and some for some kind of experimental reason i think that um
but i do think that we that that we might be that the best way to understand physics and the universe is from a
computational perspective so understanding it as an information universe and actually information being
the most fundamental unit of uh reality rather than matter or energy so a
physicist would say you know matter or energy you know e equals m c squared these are the things that are are the
fundamentals of the universe i'd actually say information um which of course itself can be can specify energy
or matter right matter is actually just you know we're we're just out the way our bodies and all the molecules in our
body arrange is information so i think information may be the most fundamental way to describe the universe and
therefore you could say we're in some sort of simulation because of that um but i don't i do i'm not i'm not really
a subscriber to the idea that um you know these are sort of throw away billions of simulations around i think
this is actually very critical and possibly unique this simulation particular one yes so but and you just
mean treating the universe as a computer that's
processing and modifying information is is a good way to solve the problems of physics of chemistry of biology
and perhaps of humanity and so on yes i think understanding physics in terms of
information theory uh might be the best way to to really uh understand what's
going on here from our understanding of a universal turing machine from our understanding of
a computer do you think there's something outside of the capabilities of a computer that is present in our
universe you have a disagreement with roger penrose the nature of consciousness he he thinks
that consciousness is more than just a computation uh do you think all of it the whole
shebang is can be can be a competition yeah i've had many fascinating debates with uh sir roger penrose and obviously
he's he's famously and i read you know emperors of new mind and and um and his books uh his classical books uh
and they they were pretty influential and you know in the 90s and um he believes that there's something more you
know something quantum that is needed to explain consciousness in the brain um i
think about what we're doing actually at deepmind and what my career is being we're almost like true rings champion so
we are pushing turing machines or classical computation to the limits what are the limits of what classical
computing can do now um and at the same time i've also studied neuroscience to
see and that's why i did my phd in was to see also to look at you know is there anything quantum in the brain from a
neuroscience or biological perspective and um and so far i think most neuroscientists and most mainstream
biologists and neuroscientists would say there's no evidence of any quantum uh systems or effects in the brain as far
as we can see it's it can be mostly explained by classical uh classical theories so
and then so there's sort of the the search from the biology side and then at the same time there's the raising of the
water uh at the bar from what classical turing machines can do uh uh and
and you know including our new ai systems and uh as you alluded to earlier
um you know i think ai especially in the last decade plus has been a continual
story now of surprising uh events uh and surprising successes knocking over one
theory after another of what was thought to be impossible you know from go to protein folding and so on and so i think
um i would be very hesitant to bet against how far the uh universal turing machine
and classical computation paradigm can go and and my betting would be
that all of certainly what's going on in our brain uh can probably be mimicked or
or approximated on a on a classical machine um not you know not requiring
something metaphysical or quantum and we'll get there with some of the work with alpha fold
which i think begins the journey of modeling this beautiful and complex world of biology so you think all the
magic of the human mind comes from this just a few pounds of mush
of a biological computational mush that's akin to some of the neural networks
not directly but in spirit that deep mind has been working with well look i
think it's um you say it's a few you know of course it's this is the i think the biggest miracle of the universe is
that um it is just a few pounds of mush in our skulls and yet it's also our brains are the most complex objects in
the in that we know of in the universe so there's something profoundly beautiful and amazing about our brains
and i think that it's an incredibly uh incredible efficient machine and and uh
uh and it's a is you know phenomenal basically and i think that building ai
one of the reasons i want to build ai and i've always wanted to is i think by building an intelligent artifact like ai
and then comparing it to the human mind um that will help us unlock the
uniqueness and the true secrets of the mind that we've always wondered about since the dawn of history like consciousness dreaming uh creativity uh
emotions what are all these things right we've we've wondered about them since since the dawn of humanity and i think
one of the reasons and you know i love philosophy and philosophy of mind is we found it difficult is there haven't been
the tools for us to really other than introspection to from very clever people in in history very clever philosophers
to really investigate this scientifically but now suddenly we have a plethora of tools firstly we have all
the neuroscience tools fmri machines single cell recording all of this stuff but we also have the ability computers
and ai to build uh intelligent systems so i think that um
uh you know i think it is amazing what the human mind does and um and and i'm kind
of in awe of it really and uh and i think it's amazing that without human minds we're able to build things like
computers and and actually even you know think and investigate about these questions i think that's also a testament to the human mind yeah the
universe built the human mind that now is building computers that help
us understand both the universe and our own human mind right that's exactly it i mean i think that's one you know one
could say we we are maybe we're the mechanism by which the universe is going to try and understand
itself yeah it's beautiful so let's let's go to the
basic building blocks of biology that i think is another angle at which you can start
to understand the human mind the human body which is quite fascinating which is from the basic building blocks start to
simulate start to model how from those building blocks you can construct bigger and bigger more complex
systems maybe one day the entirety of the human biology so here's another problem that thought to
be impossible to solve which is protein folding and alpha fold or
specific alpha fold 2 did just that it solved protein folding i think it's one of the biggest
breakthroughs uh certainly in the history of structural biology but uh in general in
in science um maybe from a high level
what is it and how does it work and then we can ask some fascinating sure questions after sure um so maybe
like to explain it uh to people not familiar with protein folding is you know i first of all explain proteins
which is you know proteins are essential to all life every function in your body depends on proteins sometimes they're
called the workhorses of biology and if you look into them and i've you know obviously as part of alpha fold i've been researching proteins and and
structural biology for the last few years you know they're amazing little bio nano machines proteins they're
incredible if you actually watch little videos of how they work animations of how they work and um proteins are specified by their
genetic sequence called the amino acid sequence so you can think of those their genetic makeup and then in the body uh
in in nature they when they when they fold up into a 3d structure so you can think of it as a string of beads and
then they fold up into a ball now the key thing is you want to know what that 3d structure is
because the structure the 3d structure of a protein is what helps to determine what does it
do the function it does in your body and also if you're interested in drug drugs or disease you need to understand
that 3d structure because if you want to target something with a drug compound or about to block that something the
protein is doing uh you need to understand where it's going to bind on the surface of the protein so obviously
in order to do that you need to understand the 3d structure so the structure is mapped to the function the structure is mapped to the function and
the structure is obviously somehow specified by the by the amino acid sequence and that's the in essence the
protein folding problem is can you just from the amino acid sequence the one-dimensional
string of letters can you immediately computationally predict the 3d structure right and this has been a
grand challenge in biology for over 50 years so i think it was first articulated by christian anfinsen a
nobel prize winner in 1972 uh as part of his nobel prize winning lecture and he
just speculated this should be possible to go from the amino acid sequence to the 3d structure we didn't say how so
i you know it's been described to me as equivalent to fermat's last theorem but for biology right you should as somebody
that uh very well might win the nobel prize in the future but outside of that you should do more of that kind of thing
in the margins just put random things that will take like 200 years to solve set people off for 200 years it should
be possible exactly and just don't give any interest exactly i think everyone's exactly should be i'll have to remember
that for future so yeah so he set off you know with this one throwaway remark just like fermat you know he he set off
this whole 50-year uh uh uh field really of computational
biology and and they had you know they got stuck they hadn't really got very far with doing this and and um until now
until alpha fold came along this is done experimentally right very painstakingly so the rule of thumb is and you have to
like crystallize the protein which is really difficult some proteins can't be crystallized like membrane proteins and
then you have to use very expensive electron microscopes or x-ray crystallography machines really
painstaking work to get the 3d structure and visualize the 3d structure so the rule of thumb in in experimental biology
is that it takes one phd student their entire phd to do one protein uh and with
alpha fold two we were able to predict the 3d structure in a matter of seconds
um and so we were you know over christmas we did the whole human proteome or every protein in the human
body all 20 000 proteins so the human proteins like the equivalent of the human genome but on protein space and uh
and sort of revolutionize really what uh a structural biologist can do because
now um they don't have to worry about these painstaking experimentals you know should they put all of that effort in or
not they can almost just look up the structure of their proteins like a google search and so there's a data set on which it's
trained and how to map this amino acids because first of all it's incredible that a protein this little chemical
computer is able to do that computation itself in some kind of distributed way and do it very quickly
that's a weird thing and they evolved that way because you know in the beginning i mean that's a great invention just the
protein itself yes i mean and then they there's i think probably a history of
like uh they evolved to have many of these proteins and those proteins figure out how to be computers
themselves in such a way that you can create structures that can interact in complexes with each other in order to
form high level functions i mean it's a weird system that they figured it out well for sure i mean we you know maybe
we should talk about the origins of life too but proteins themselves i think are magical and incredible uh uh uh as i
said little little bio-nano machines and um and and actually levantal who is another
scientist uh uh a contemporary of anfinsen uh he he coined this eleventh
house what became known as levantal's paradox which is exactly what you're saying he calculated roughly a protein
an average protein which is maybe 2 000 amino acids bases long is um
is is can fold in maybe 10 to the power 300 different conformations so there's
10 to the power 300 different ways that protein could fold up and yet somehow in nature physics solves this solves this
in a matter of milliseconds so proteins fold up in your body in you know sometimes in fractions of a second so
physics is somehow solving that search problem and just to be clear in many of these cases maybe you correct me if i'm
wrong there's often a unique way for that sequence to form itself yes so
among that huge number of possibilities yes it figures out a way how to stability
uh in some cases there might be a misfunction so on which leads to a lot of the disorders and stuff like that but
yes most of the time it's a unique mapping and that unique mapping is not obvious no exactly that's just what the
problem is exactly so there's a unique mapping usually in a healthy in if it's healthy and as you say in disease
so for example alzheimer's one one one conjecture is that it's because of a misfolded protein a protein that folds
in the wrong way amyloid beta protein so um and then because it falls in the wrong way it gets tangled up right in
your in your neurons so um it's super important to understand both healthy functioning and also
disease is to understand uh you know what what these things are doing and how they're structuring of course the next
step is sometimes proteins change shape when they interact with something so um they're not just static necessarily in
in biology maybe you can give some interesting sort of beautiful things to you about these
early days of alpha fold of of solving this problem because unlike games this is
real physical systems that are less amenable to
self-play type of mechanisms the the size of the data set is smaller that you might otherwise like so you
have to be very clever about certain things is there something you could speak to um what was very hard to solve and what are
some beautiful aspects about the the solution yeah i would say alpha fold is the most complex and also probably most
meaningful system we've built so far so it's been an amazing time actually in the last you know two three years to see
that come through because um as we talked about earlier you know games is what we started on uh building things
like alphago and alpha zero but really the ultimate goal was to um not just to crack games it was just to to to build
use them to bootstrap general learning systems we could then apply to real world challenges specifically my passion
is scientific challenges like protein folding and then alpha fold of course is our first big proof point of that and so
um you know in terms of the data uh and the amount of innovations that had to go into it we you know it was like more
than 30 different component algorithms needed to be put together to crack the protein folding um i think some of the
big innovations were that um kind of building in some hard coded constraints around physics and
evolutionary biology um to constrain sort of things like the bond angles uh
uh in the in the in the protein and things like that um a lot but not to impact the learning
system so still allowing uh the system to be able to learn the physics uh
itself um from the examples that we had and the examples as you say there are only about 150 000 proteins even after
40 years of experimental biology only around 150 000 proteins have been the structures have been found out about so
that was our training set which is um much less than normally we would like to use
but using various tricks things like self distillation so actually using alpha folds predictions um some of the
best predictions that it thought was highly confident in we put them back into the training set right to make the
training set bigger that was critical to to alpha fold working so there was actually a huge
number of different um uh innovations like that that were required to to ultimately crack the problem after fold
one what it produced was a distagram so a kind of a matrix of the pairwise distances
between all of the molecules in the in the in the protein and then there had to be a separate optimization process to uh
create the 3d structure and what we did for alpha volt2 is make it truly end to end so we went straight
from the amino acid sequence of of of bases to the 3d structure directly without going
through this intermediate step and in machine learning what we've always found is that the more end to end you can make
it the better the system and it's probably because um we you know the in
the end the system is better at learning what the constraints are than than we are as the human designers of specifying
it so anytime you can let it flow end to end and actually just generate what it is you're really looking for in this
case the 3d structure you're better off than having this intermediate step which you then have to hand craft the next
step for so so it's better to let the gradients and the learning flow all the way through the system um from the end point the end
output you want to the inputs so that's a good way to start a new problem handcraft a bunch of stuff add a bunch
of manual constraints with a small intent learning piece or a small learning piece and grow that learning
piece until it consumes the whole thing that's right and so you can also see you know this is a bit of a method we've
developed over doing many sort of successful outfits we call them alpha x projects right is and the easiest way to
see that is the evolution of alphago to alpha zero so alphago was um a learning
system but it was specifically trained to only play go right so uh and what we wanted to do with first version of go is
just get to world champion performance no matter how we did it right and then and then of course alphago zero we we we
removed the need to use human games as a starting point right so it could just play against itself from random starting
point from the beginning so that removed the the need for human knowledge uh about go and then finally alpha zero
then generalized it so that any things we had in there the system including things like symmetry of the go board uh
were removed so the alpha zero could play from scratch any two player game and then mu0 which is the final
latest version of that set of things was then extending it so that you didn't even have to give it the rules of the
game it would learn that for itself so it could also deal with computer games as well as board games so that line of
alpha golf goes zero alpha zero mu zero that's the full trajectory of what you
can take from uh imitation learning to full self
supervised learning yeah exactly and learning learning uh the entire structure of the environment you put in
from scratch right and and and and bootstrapping it uh through self-play uh yourself but the thing is it would have
been impossible i think or very hard for us to build alpha zero or mu0 first out of the box
even psychologically because you have to believe in yourself for a very long time you're constantly dealing with doubt
because a lot of people say that it's impossible exactly so it was hard enough just to do go as you were saying everyone thought that was impossible or
at least a decade away um from when we when we did it back in 2015 24 you know
2016 and um and so yes it would have been psychologically probably very difficult
as well as the fact that of course we learnt a lot by building alphago first right so it's i think this is why i call
ai in engineering science it's one of the most fascinating science disciplines but it's also an engineering science in
the sense that unlike natural sciences um the phenomenon you're studying it doesn't exist out in nature you have to
build it first so you have to build the artifact first and then you can study how how and pull it apart and how it
works this is tough to uh ask you this question because you probably will say it's everything but
let's let's try let's try to think to this because you're in a very interesting position where deepmind is
the place of some of the most uh brilliant ideas in the history of ai but it's also a place of brilliant
engineering so how much of solving intelligence this big goal for deepmind how much of it is
science how much is engineering so how much is the algorithms how much is the data how much is the
hardware compute infrastructure how much is it the software computer infrastructure yeah um what else is
there how much is the human infrastructure and like just the humans interact in certain kinds of ways in all the space
of all those ideas how much does maybe like philosophy how much what's the key if um
uh if if you were to sort of look back like if we go forward 200 years look back
what was the key thing that solved intelligence is that ideas i think it's a combination first of all
of course it's a combination of all those things but the the ratios of them changed over over time
so yeah so um even in the last 12 years so we started deep mine in 2010 which is hard to imagine now because 2010 it's
only 12 short years ago but nobody was talking about ai uh you know if you remember back to your mit days you know
no one was talking about it i did a postdoc at mit back around then and it was sort of thought of as a well look we
know ai doesn't work we tried this hard in the 90s at places like mit mostly losing using logic systems and
old-fashioned sort of good old-fashioned ai we would call it now um people like minsky and and and patrick winston and
you know all these characters right and used to debate a few of them and they used to think i was mad thinking about that some new advance could be done with
learning systems and um i was actually pleased to hear that because at least you know you're on a unique track at
that point right even if every all of your you know professors are telling you you're mad that's true and of course in
industry uh you can we couldn't get you know as difficult to get two cents together uh and which is hard to imagine
now as well given it's the biggest sort of buzzword in in vcs and and fundraising's easy and all these kind of
things today so back in 2010 it was very difficult and what we the reason we started then and
shane and i used to discuss um uh uh what were the sort of founding tenets of deep mind and it was very various things
one was um algorithmic advances so deep learning you know jeff hinton and cohen just had just sort of invented that in
academia but no one in industry knew about it uh we love reinforcement learning we thought that could be scaled
up but also understanding about the human brain had advanced um quite a lot uh in the decade prior with fmri
machines and other things so we could get some good hints about architectures and algorithms and and sort of um
representations maybe that the brain uses so as at a systems level not at a implementation level um and then the
other big things were compute and gpus right so we could see a compute was going to be really useful and it got to
a place where it became commoditized mostly through the games industry and and that could be taken advantage of and
then the final thing was also mathematical and theoretical definitions of intelligence so things like ai xi aix
which uh shane worked on with his supervisor marcus hutter which is a sort of theoretical uh proof really of
universal intelligence um which is actually a reinforcement learning system um in the limit i mean it assumes
infinite compute and infinite memory in the way you know like a turing machine proof but i was also waiting to see
something like that too to you know like turing machines uh and and computation theory that people like turing and
shannon came up with underpins modern computer science um uh you know i was waiting for a theory like that to sort
of underpin agi research so when i you know met shane and saw he was working on something like that you know that to me
was a sort of final piece of the jigsaw so in the early days i would say that
ideas were the most important uh you know and for us it was deep reinforcement learning scaling up deep
learning um of course we've seen transformers so huge leaps i would say you know three or four from for if you
think from 2010 until now uh huge evolutions things like alphago um and um
and and maybe there's a few more still needed but as we get closer to ai agi um
i think engineering becomes more and more important and data because scale and of course the the recent you know
results of gpt3 and all the big language models and large models including our ones uh has shown that scale is a is and
large models are clearly going to be unnecessary but perhaps not sufficient part of an agi solution and
throughout that like you said and i'd like to give you a big thank you you're one of the pioneers in this is
sticking by ideas like reinforcement learning that this can actually work
given actually limited success in the past and also
which we still don't know but proudly having the best researchers in the world
and talking about solving intelligence so talking about whatever you call it agi or something like this
that speaking of mit that's that's just something not you wouldn't bring up no uh not not maybe you did in uh like 40
50 years ago but that was um ai was a place where you do tinkering
very small scale not very ambitious projects and maybe the biggest ambitious projects
were in the space of robotics and doing like the darpa challenge sure but the task of solving intelligence and
believing you can that's really really powerful so in order for engineering to do its work
to have great engineers build great systems you have to have that belief that threats throughout the whole thing
that you can actually solve some of these impossible challenges yeah that's right and and back in 2010 you know our
mission statement um and still is today you know it was used to be uh solving step one solve intelligence step two use
it to solve everything else yes so if you can imagine pitching that to a vc in 2010 you know the kind of looks we we
got we managed to you know find a few uh kooky people to back us but it was uh it was tricky and and i and i got to the
point where we we wouldn't mention it to any of our professors because they would just eye roll and think we you know
committed career suicide and and uh and and you know so it was there's a lot of things that we had to do but we always
believed it and one reason you know by the way one reason we i believe i've always believed in reinforcement learning is that
that if you look at neuroscience that is the way that the you know primate brain learns one of the main mechanisms is the
dopamine system implement some form of td learning a very famous result in the late 90s uh where they saw this in
monkeys and uh and as a you know proper game prediction error so we you know again in the limit this is this is what
i think you can use neuroscience for is is you know any at mathematics you when you're when you're doing something as
ambitious as trying to solve intelligence and you're you're you know it's blue sky research no one knows how to do it you you you need to use any
evidence or any source of information you can to help guide you in the right direction or give you confidence you're
going in the right direction so so that that was one reason we pushed so hard on that and that's and just going back to
your early question about organization the other big thing that i think we innovated with at deepmind to encourage
invention and and uh and innovation was the multi-disciplinary organization we
built and we still have today so deepmind originally was a confluence of the of the most cutting-edge knowledge
in neuroscience with machine learning engineering and mathematics right and and gaming
and then since then we built that out even further so we have philosophers here and and uh by you know ethicists
but also other types of scientists physicists and so on um and that's what brings together i tried to build a sort
of um new type of bell labs but in this golden era right uh
and and a new expression of that um to try and uh foster this incredible sort
of innovation machine so talking about the humans in the machine the mind itself is a learning machine
with a lots of amazing human minds in it coming together to try and build these uh learning systems
if we return to the big ambitious dream of alpha fold that may be the early steps on a very
long journey in um in biology
do you think the same kind of approach can use to predict the structure and function of more complex biological
systems so multi-protein interaction and then i mean you can go out from there just
simulating bigger and bigger systems that eventually simulate something like the human brain or the human body just
the big mush the mess of the beautiful resilient mesobiology do do you see that
as a long-term vision i do and i think um you know if you think about what are the
things top things i wanted to apply ai ai2 once we had powerful enough systems biology and curing diseases and
understanding biology uh was right up there you know top of my list that's one of the reasons i personally pushed that
myself and with alpha fold but i think alpha fold uh amazing as it is is just
the beginning um and and and i hope it's evidence of uh what could be done with
computational methods so um you know alpha fold solve this this huge problem of the structure of proteins but biology
is dynamic so really what i imagine from here we're working on all these things now is protein protein interaction uh
protein ligand binding so reacting with molecules um then you want to get build up to pathways and then eventually a
virtual cell that's my dream uh maybe in the next 10 years and i've been talking actually to a lot of biologists friends
of mine paul nurse who runs the qrik institute amazing biologist nobel prize winning biologist we've been discussing
for 20 years now virtual cells could you build a virtual simulation of a cell and
if you could that would be incredible for biology and disease discovery because you could do loads of experiments on the virtual cell and then
only at the last stage validate it in the wet lab so you could you know in terms of the search space of discovering
new drugs you know it takes 10 years roughly to go from uh uh to to go from uh you know identifying a target to uh
having a drug candidate um maybe that could be shortened to you know by an order of magnitude with if you could do
most of that that that work in silico so in order to get to a virtual cell
we have to build up uh uh understanding of different parts of biology and the interactions and and um so you know
every every few years we talk about this with i talked about this with paul and then finally last year after alpha fault
i said now is the time we can finally go for it and and alpha falls the first proof point that this might be possible
uh and he's very excited when we have some collaborations with his with his lab they're just across the road actually from us as you know wonderful
being here in king's cross with the quick institute across the road and um and i think the next steps you know i
think there's going to be some amazing advances in biology built on top of things like alpha fold uh we're already
seeing that with the community doing that after we've open sourced it and released it um and uh you know i also i
often say that i think uh if you think of mathematics is the perfect description language for physics
i think ai might be end up being the perfect description language for biology because
biology is so messy it's so emergent so dynamic and complex um i think i find it
very hard to believe we'll ever get to something as elegant as newton's laws of motions to describe a cell right it's
just too complicated um so i think ai is the right tool for this you have to uh
you have to start at the basic building blocks and use ai to run the simulation for all those building blocks so have a
very strong way to do prediction of what given these building blocks what kind of biology how the
the function and the evolution of that biological system it's almost like a cellular automata you
have to run you can't analyze it from a high level you have to take the basic ingredients figure out the rules yeah
and let it run but in this case the rules are very difficult to figure out yes yes learn them that's exactly it so
it's the biology is too complicated to figure out the rules it's it's it's too emergent too dynamic say compared to a
physics system like the motion of a planet yeah right and and so you have to learn the rules and that's exactly the
type of systems that we're building so you you mentioned you've open sourced alpha fold and even the data involved
to me personally also really happy and a big thank you for open sourcing mijoko
uh the physics simulation engine that's that's often used for robotics research
and so on so i think that's a pretty gangster move uh so what what's the
what's i mean this uh very few companies or people would do
that kind of thing what's the philosophy behind that you know it's a case-by-case basis and in both those cases we felt
that was the maximum benefit to humanity to do that and and the scientific community in one case the robotics uh
physics community with mojoco so purchased it we purchased to obs we purchased it for the express
principle to open source it so um so you know i hope people appreciate that
it's great to hear that you do and then the second thing was and mostly we did it because the person building it is uh
uh would not it was not able to cope with supporting it anymore because it was it got too big for him his amazing
professor uh who who built it in the first place so we helped him out with that and then with alpha folds even
bigger i would say and i think in that case we decided that there were so many downstream applications of alpha fold um
that we couldn't possibly even imagine what they all were so the best way to accelerate uh drug discovery and also
fundamental research would be to to um give all that data away and and and the
and the and the system itself um you know it's been so gratifying to see what people have done that within just one
year which is a short amount of time in science and uh it's been used by over 500 000 researchers have used it we
think that's almost every biologist in the world i think there's roughly 500 000 biologists in the world professional biologists have used it to to look at
their proteins of interest we've seen amazing fundamental research done so a couple of weeks ago front
cover there was a whole special issue of science including the front cover which had the nuclear pore complex on it which
is one of the biggest proteins in the body the nuclear poor complex is a protein that governs all the nutrients
going in and out of your cell nucleus so they're like little hole gateways that open and close to let things go in and
out of your cell nucleus so they're really important but they're huge because they're massive doughnut rings shaped things and they've been looking
to try and figure out that structure for decades and they have lots of you know experimental data but it's too low
resolution there's bits missing and they were able to like a giant lego jigsaw puzzle use alpha fold predictions plus
experimental data and combined those two independent sources of information uh actually four different groups around
the world were able to put it together the sec more or less simultaneously using alpha fault predictions so that's
been amazing to see and pretty much every pharma company every drug company executive i've spoken to has said that
their teams are using alpha fold to accelerate whatever drugs uh uh they're
trying to discover so i think the knock-on effect has been enormous in terms of uh the impact that uh
alpha-fold has made and it's probably bringing in it's creating biologists it's bringing more people into the field
um both on the excitement and both on the technical skills involved and um
it's almost like uh a gateway drug to biology yes it is you get more computational people involved too
hopefully and and i think for us you know the next stage as i said you know in future we have to have other
considerations too we're building on top of alpha fold and these other ideas i discussed with you about protein protein interactions and and genomics and other
things and not everything will be open source some of it will will do commercially because that will be the best way to actually get the most
resources and impact behind it in other ways some other projects will do non-profit style um and also we have to
consider for future things as well safety and ethics as well like but you know synthetic biology there are you
know there is dual use and we have to think about that as well with alpha fold we you know we consulted with 30
different bioethicists and and other people expert in this field to make sure it was safe before um we released it so
there'll be other considerations in future but for right now you know i think alpha fold is a kind of a gift from us to to to the scientific
community so i'm pretty sure that something like alpha fold
uh would be part of nobel prizes in the future but us humans of course are horrible
with credit assignment so we'll of course give it to the humans do you think there will be a day
when ai system can't be denied that it earned that nobel prize do you
think we'll see that in 21st century it depends what type of ais we end up building right whether they're um
you know goal seeking agents who specifies the goals uh who comes up with the hypotheses
who you know who determines which problems to tackle right so i think it's about an announcement yeah so it's
announcing the results exactly as part of it um so i think right now of course it's it's it's it's amazing human
ingenuity that's behind these systems and then the system in my opinion is just a tool you know it'd be a bit like
saying with galileo and his telescope you know the ingenuity the the the credit should go to the telescope i mean
it's clearly galileo building the tool which he then uses so i still see that in the same way
today even though these tools learn for themselves um they're i think i think of things like alpha fold and that the
things we're building as the ultimate tools for science and for acquiring new knowledge to help us as scientists
acquire new knowledge i think one day there will come a point where an ai system may solve or come up with
something like general relativity of its own bat not just by averaging everything on the internet or
averaging everything on pubmed although that would be interesting to see what that would come up with um so
that to me is a bit like our earlier debate about creativity you know inventing go rather than just coming up
with a good go move and um so i think uh solving i think to to you know if we
wanted to give it the credit of like a nobel type of thing then it would need to invent go uh and sort of invent that
new conjecture out of the blue um rather than being specified by the the human
scientists or the human creators so i think right now that's it's definitely just a tool although it is interesting
how far you get by averaging everything on the internet like you said because you know a lot of people do see science as you're
always standing on the shoulders of giants and the question is how much are you really
reaching up above the shoulders of giants maybe it's just assimilating different kinds
of results of the past with ultimately this new perspective that gives you this breakthrough idea
but that idea may not be novel in the way that we can't be already discovered on the internet maybe
the nobel prizes of the next 100 years are already all there on the internet to be discovered
they could be they could be i mean i think um this is one of the big mysteries i think
is that uh uh i i first of all i believe a lot of the big new breakthroughs that are going
to come in the next few decades and even in the last decade are going to come at the intersection between different subject areas where um there'll be some
new connection that's found between what seemingly with disparate areas and and one can even think of deep mind as i
said earlier as a sort of interdisciplinary between neuroscience ideas and ai engineering ideas uh
originally and so um so i think there's that and then one of the things we can't
imagine today is and one of the reasons i think people we were so surprised by how well large models worked is that
actually it's very hard for our human minds our limited human minds to understand what it would be like to read the whole
internet right i think we can do a thought experiment and i used to do this of like well what if i read the whole of
wikipedia what would i know and i think our minds can just about comprehend maybe what that would be like but the whole
internet is beyond comprehension so i think we just don't understand what it would be like to be able to hold all of
that in mind potentially right and then active at once and then maybe what are
the connections that are available there so i think no doubt there are huge things to be discovered just like that
but i do think there is this other type of creativity of true spark of new knowledge new idea never thought before
about can't be average from things that are known um that really of course everything come you know nobody creates
in a vacuum so there must be clues somewhere but just a unique way of putting those things together i think
some of the greatest scientists in history have displayed that i would say although it's very hard to know going
back to their time what was exactly known uh when they came up with those things although
you're making me really think because just the thought experiment of deeply knowing a hundred wikipedia pages
i don't think i can um i've been really impressed by wikipedia for for technical topics yeah so if you
know a hundred pages or a thousand pages i don't think who can visually truly
comprehend what's what kind of intelligence that is that's a pretty powerful intelligence if you
know how to use that and integrate that information correctly yes i think you can go really far you can probably
construct thought experiments based on that like simulate different ideas so if this
is true let me run this thought experiment then maybe this is true it's not really invention it's like just
taking literally the knowledge and using it to construct a very basic simulation of the world i mean some argue it's
romantic in part but einstein would do the same kind of things with a thought experiment yeah one could imagine doing
that systematically across millions of wikipedia pages plus pubmed all these things i think there are
many many things to be discovered like that they're hugely useful you know you could imagine and i want us to do some
of those things in material science like room temperature superconductors or something on my list one day i'd like to
like you know have an ai system to help build better optimized batteries all of these sort of mechanical things mr i
think a systematic sort of search could be uh guided by a model could be um could be
extremely powerful so speaking of which you have a paper on nuclear fusion
uh magnetic control of tokamak plasmas to deep reinforcement learning so you uh
you're seeking to solve nuclear fusion with deep rl so it's doing control of high temperature plasmas can you explain this
work and uh can ai eventually solve nuclear fusion it's been very fun last year or two and
very productive because we've been taking off a lot of my dream projects if you like of things that i've collected over the years of
areas of science that i would like to i think could be very transformative if we helped accelerate and uh really
interesting problems scientific challenges in of themselves this is energy so energy yes exactly so
energy and climate so we talked about disease and biology as being one of the biggest places i think ai can help with
i think energy and climate uh is another one so maybe they would be my top two um
and fusion is one one area i think ai can help with now fusion has many challenges mostly physics material
science and engineering challenges as well to build these massive fusion reactors and contain the plasma and what
we try to do whenever we go into a new field to apply our systems is we look for um
we talk to domain experts we try and find the best people in the world to collaborate with um
in this case in fusion we we collaborated with epfl in switzerland the swiss technical institute who are amazing they have a test reactor that
they were willing to let us use which you know i double checked with the team we were going to use carefully and safely
i was impressed they managed to persuade them to let us use it and um and it's a it's an amazing test reactor they have
there and they try all sorts of pretty crazy experiments on it and um the the
the what we tend to look at is if we go into a new domain like fusion what are all the bottleneck problems uh like
thinking from first principles you know what are all the bottleneck problems that are still stopping fusion working today and then we look at we you know we
get a fusion expert to tell us and then we look at those bottlenecks and we look at the ones which ones are amenable to
our ai methods today yes right and and and then and would be interesting from a research perspective from our point of
view from an ai point of view and that would address one of their bottlenecks and in this case plasma control was was
perfect so you know the plasma it's a million degrees celsius something like that it's hotter than the sun
and there's obviously no material that can contain it so they have to be containing these magnetic very powerful
superconducting magnetic fields but the problem is plasma is pretty unstable as you imagine you're kind of holding a
mini sun mini star in a reactor so you know you you kind of want to predict
ahead of time what the plasma's going to do so you can move the magnetic field within a few
milliseconds you know to to basically contain what it's going to do next so it seems like a perfect problem if you
think of it for like a reinforcement learning prediction problem so uh you know your controller you're gonna move
the magnetic field and until we came along you know they were they were doing it with with traditional operational uh
research type of uh controllers uh which are kind of handcrafted and the problem is of course they can't react in the
moment to something the plasma's doing that they have to be hard-coded and again knowing that that's normally our
go-to solution is we would like to learn that instead and they also had a simulator of these plasma so there were
lots of criteria that matched what we we like to to to use so can ai eventually solve nuclear
fusion well so we with this problem and we published it in a nature paper last year uh we held the fusion that we held
the plasma in specific shapes so actually it's almost like carving the plasma into different shapes and control
and hold it there for the record amount of time so um so that's one of the problems of of fusion sort of um solved
so i have a controller that's able to no matter the shape uh contain it continue yeah contain it and hold it in structure
and there's different shapes that are better for for the energy productions called droplets and and and so on so um
so that was huge and now we're looking we're talking to lots of fusion startups to see what's the next problem we can
tackle uh in the fusion area so another fascinating place
in a paper title pushing the frontiers of density functionals by solving the fractional electron problem so you're
taking on modeling and simulating the quantum mechanical behavior of electrons yes
um can you explain this work and can ai model and simulate arbitrary quantum
mechanical systems in the future yeah so this is another problem i've had my eye on for you know a decade or more which
is um uh sort of simulating the properties of electrons if you can do that you can
basically describe how elements and materials and substances work so it's
kind of like fundamental if you want to advance material science um and uh you know we have schrodinger's equation and
then we have approximations to that density functional theory these things are you know are famous and um people
try and write approximations to to these uh uh to these functionals and and kind of come up with descriptions of the
electron clouds where they're gonna go how they're gonna interact when you put two elements together uh and what we try
to do is learn a simulation uh uh learner functional that will describe more chemistry types of chemistry so um
until now you know you can run expensive simulations but then you can only simulate very small uh molecules very
simple molecules we would like to simulate large materials um and so uh today there's no way of doing that and
we're building up towards uh building functionals that approximate schrodinger's equation and then allow
you to describe uh what the electrons are doing and all materials sort of science and
material properties are governed by the electrons and and how they interact so have a good summarization of the
simulation through the functional um but one that is still
close to what the actual simulation would come out with so what um how difficult is that to ask what's
involved in that task is it running those those complicated simulations yeah and learning the task of mapping from the
initial conditions and the parameters of the simulation learning what the functional would be yeah so it's pretty
tricky and we've done it with um you know the nice thing is we there are we can run a lot of the simulations that
the molecular dynamics simulations on our compute clusters and so that generates a lot of data so in this case
the data is generated so we like those sort of systems and that's why we use games simulator generated data
and we can kind of create as much of it as we want really um and just let's leave some you know if any computers are
free in the cloud we just run we run some of these calculations right compute cluster calculation that's all the the
free compute times used up on quantum mechanics quantum mechanics exactly simulations and protein simulations and
other things and so um and so you know when you're not searching on youtube for video cat videos we're using those
computers usefully and quantum chemistry that's the idea and and putting them for good use and
then yeah and then all of that computational data that's generated we can then try and learn the functionals
from that which of course are way more efficient once we learn the functional than um
running those simulations would be do you think one day ai may allow us to
do something like basically crack open physics so do something like travel faster than the speed of light
my ultimate aim has always been with ai is um the reason i am personally working on
ai for my whole life it was to build a tool to help us understand stand the universe so i wanted to and that means
physics really and the nature of reality so um uh i don't think we have systems that
are capable of doing that yet but when we get towards agi i think um that's one of the first things i think we should
apply agi to i would like to test the limits of physics and our knowledge of physics there's so many things we don't know
there's one thing i find fascinating about science and you know as a huge proponent of the scientific method as
being one of the greatest ideas humanity's ever had and allowed us to progress with our knowledge
but i think as a true scientist i think what you find is the more you find out uh you the more you realize we don't
know and and i always think that it's surprising that more people don't aren't troubled you know every night i think
about all these things we interact with all the time that we have no idea how they work time
consciousness gravity life we can't i mean these are all the fundamental things of nature i think the
way we don't really know what they are to live life we uh pin certain
assumptions on them and kind of treat our assumptions as if they're a fact yeah that allows us to sort of box them
off somehow yeah box them off but the reality is when you think of time
you should remind yourself you should put it off the sh take it off the shelf and realize like
no we have a bunch of assumptions there's still a lot of there's even now a lot of debate there's a lot of uncertainty about exactly what is time
uh is there an error of time you know there's there's a lot of fundamental questions you can't just make
assumptions about and maybe ai allows you to um
not put anything on the shelf yeah not make any uh hard assumptions and really open it up and see what
exactly i think we should be truly open-minded about that and uh exactly that not be dogmatic to a particular
theory um it'll also allow us to build better tools experimental tools eventually
that can then test certain theories that may not be testable today about as things about like
what we spoke about at the beginning about the computational nature of the universe how one might if that was true
how one might go about testing that right and and how much uh you know there are people who've conjectured people
like uh scott aronson and others about uh you know how much information can a specific planck unit of space and time
contain right so one might be able to think about testing those ideas if you had um
ai helping you build some new exquisite uh uh experimental tools this is what i
imagine you know many decades from now we'll be able to do and what kind of questions can be answered through
running a simulation of of them so there's a bunch of physics simulations you can imagine that could
be run in an uh so some kind of efficient way much like you're doing in the quantum
simulation work and perhaps even the origin of life so figuring out how
going even back before the work of alpha fault begins of how this whole whole thing
um emerges from a rock yes from a static thing would what do you do you think ai
will allow us to is that something you have your eye on it's trying to understand the origin of life first of
all yourself what do you think um how the heck did life originate on earth
yeah well maybe we i'll come to that in a second but i think the ultimate use of ai is to
kind of use it to accelerate science to the maximum so i um think of it a little bit like the
tree of all knowledge if you imagine that's all the knowledge there is in the universe to attain and we sort of barely scratched the
surface of that so far in even though you know we've we've done pretty well since the enlightenment right as
humanity and i think ai will turbo charge all of that like we've seen with alpha fold and i want to explore as much
of that tree of knowledge as it's possible to do and um and i think that involves ai helping us with with with
understanding or finding patterns um but also potentially designing and building new tools experimental tools so i think
that's all uh and also running simulations and learning simulations all of that we're
already we're sort of doing it at a at a at a you know baby steps level here but
i can imagine that in in in the decades to come as uh you know what's the full
flourishing of of that line of thinking it's going to be truly incredible i would say if i visualize this tree of
knowledge something tells me that that knowledge for tree of knowledge for humans is much smaller
in the set of all possible trees of knowledge is actually quite small giving our cognitive
limitations limited cognitive capabilities that even
with with the tools we build we still won't be able to understand a lot of things and that's perhaps what non-human
systems might be able to reach farther not just as tools but in themselves understanding
something that they can bring back yeah it could well be so i mean there's so many things that that are sort of
encapsulated in what you just said there i think first of all um there's there's two different things there's like what do we understand today
yeah what could the human mind understand and what is the totality of what is there to be understood yeah
right and so there's three consensus you know you can think of them as three larger and larger trees or exploring
more branches of that tree and i i think with ai we're going to explore that whole lot now the question is is uh you
know if you think about what is the totality of what could be understood um there may be some fundamental physics
reasons why certain things can't be understood like what's outside the simulation or outside the universe maybe
it's not understandable from within the universe so that's there may be some hard constraints like that you know it could
be smaller constraints like um we think of space time as fundamental
us our human brains are really used to this idea of a three-dimensional world with time right
maybe but our tools could go beyond that they wouldn't have that limitation necessary they could think in 11
dimensions 12 dimensions whatever is needed but um we could still maybe understand that in several different
ways the example i always give is um when i you know play gary kasparov at speed chess or we've talked about chess
and these kind of things um you know he if you if you if you're reasonably good at chess you can um you can't come up
with the move gary comes up with in his move but he can explain it to you and you can understand and you can understand post hoc the reasoning yeah
so so i think there's a there's an even further level of like well maybe you couldn't have invented that thing but
but using like going back to using language again perhaps you can understand and appreciate that same way
like you can appreciate you know vivaldi or mozart or something without you can appreciate the beauty of that without um
being able to to construct it yourself right invent the music yourself so i think we see this in all forms of life
so it'll be that times you know a million but it would you can imagine also one sign of intelligence is the
ability to explain things clearly and simply right you know people like richard feynman another one of my all-time heroes used to say that right
if you can't you know if you can explain it something simply then you that's a that's the best sign a complex topic
simply then that's one of the best signs of you understanding it yeah so i can see myself talking trash in the ai
system in that way yes uh it gets frustrated how dumb i am and trying to explain something to me i was
like well that means you're not intelligent because if you were intelligent you'd be able to explain it simply yeah of course you know there's
also the other option of course we could enhance ourselves and and without devices we we are already sort of
symbiotic with our compute devices right with our phones and other things and you know this stuff like neural link and etc
that could be could could advance that further um so i think there's lots of lots of really amazing possibilities uh
that i could foresee from here well let me ask you some wild questions so out there looking for friends
do you think there's a lot of alien civilizations out there so i guess this also goes back to your
origin of life question too because i think that that's key um my personal opinion looking at all this
and and you know it's one of my hobbies physics i guess so so i i you know it's something i think about a lot and talk
to a lot of experts on and and and read a lot of books on and i think my feeling currently is that that we are
alone i think that's the most likely scenario given what what evidence we have so um and the reasoning is i think
that you know we've tried since uh things like seti program and i guess since the
dawning of the the space age uh we've you know had telescopes open radio telescopes and other things and if you
think about um and try to detect signals now if you think about the evolution of humans on earth we could have easily
been um a million years ahead of our time now or million years behind quite
easily with just some slightly different quirk thing happening hundreds of thousands years ago uh you know things
could have been slightly different if the bto had hit the dinosaurs a million years earlier maybe things would have evolved uh we'd be a million years
ahead of where we are now so what that means is if you imagine where humanity will be in a few hundred years let alone
a million years especially if we hopefully um you know solve things like climate change and other things and we continue
to flourish and we build things like ai and we do space traveling and all of the stuff
that that humans have dreamed of for forever right and sci-fi has talked about forever um
we will be spreading across the stars right and void neumann famously calculated you know it would only take
about a million years if you send out von neumann probes to the nearest you know the nearest uh uh other solar
systems and and then they built all they did was build two more versions of themselves and set those two out to the
next nearest systems uh you you know within a million years i think you would have one of these probes in every system
in the galaxy so it's not actually in cosmo cosmological time that's actually a very short amount of time
so and and you know we've people like dyson have thought about constructing dyson spheres around stars to collect
all the energy coming out of the star you know that there would be constructions like that would be visible across base um probably even across a
galaxy so and then you know if you think about all of our radio television uh
emissions that have gone out since since the you know 30s and 40s um imagine a
million years of that and now hundreds of civilizations doing that when we opened our ears at the point we got
technologically sophisticated enough in the space age we should have heard a cacophony of voices we should
have joined that cacophony of voices and what we did we opened our ears and we heard nothing
and many people who argue that there are aliens would say well we haven't really done exhaustive search yet and maybe
we're looking in the wrong bands and and we've got the wrong devices and we wouldn't notice what an alien form was
like to be so different to what we're used to but you know i'm not i don't really buy that that it shouldn't be as
difficult as that like we i think we've searched enough there should be if it were everywhere if it was it should be everywhere we should see dyson's fears
being put up sun's blinking in and out you know there should be a lot of evidence for those things and then there are other people argue well the sort of
safari view of like well we're a primitive species still because we're not space faring yet and and and we're
you know there's some kind of globe like universal rule not to interfere star trek rule but like look look we can't
even coordinate humans to deal with climate change and we're one species what is the chance that of all of these
different human civilization you know alien civilizations they would have the same priorities and and and and agree
across you know these kind of matters and even if that was true and we were in some sort of safari for our own good to
me that's not much different from the simulation hypothesis because what does it mean the simulation hypothesis i think in its most fundamental level it
means what we're seeing is not quite reality right it's something there's something more deeper underlying it
maybe computational now if we were in a if we were in a sort of safari park and
everything we were seeing was a hologram and it was projected by the aliens or whatever that to me is not much different than thinking we're inside of
another universe because we still can't see true reality right i mean there's there's other explanations it could be
that the way they're communicating is just fundamentally different that we're too dumb to understand the much better
methods of communication they have it could be i mean i mean it's silly to say but
our own thoughts could be the methods by which they're communicating like the place from which our ideas writers talk
about this like the muse yeah it sounds like very kind of uh
wild but it could be thoughts it could be some interactions with our mind that we
think are originating from us is actually something that uh
is coming from other life forms elsewhere consciousness itself might be that it could be but i don't see any
sensible argument to the why why would all of the alien species be using this way yes some of them will be more
primitive they would be close to our level you know there would there should be a whole sort of normal distribution
of these things right some would be aggressive some would be you know curious others would be very stoical and
philosophical because you know maybe they're a million years older than us but it's not it shouldn't be like what i
mean one one alien civilization might be like that communicating thoughts and others but i don't see why you know
potentially the hundreds there should be would be uniform in this way right it could be a violent dictatorship that the
the people the alien civilizations that uh become successful
become um [Music] gain the ability to be destructive an
order of magnitude more destructive but of course the the sad thought
well either humans are very special we took a lot of leaps that arrived at what it
means to be human yeah um there's a question there which was the hardest which was the most special but
also if others have reached this level and maybe many others have reached this level the great filter
that prevented them from going farther to becoming a multi-planetary species or reaching out into the stars
and those are really important questions for us whether um whether there's other alien
civilizations out there or not this is very useful for us to think about if we destroy ourselves
how will we do it and how easy is it to do yeah well you know these are big questions and i've thought about these a
lot but the the the interesting thing is that if we're if we're alone that's somewhat comforting from the
great filter perspective because it probably means the great filters were are past us and i'm pretty sure they are
so that by in going back to your origin of life question there are some incredible things that no one knows how
happened like obviously the first life form from chemical soup that seems pretty hard but i would guess the
multicellular i wouldn't be that surprised if we saw single single cell sort of life forms elsewhere
uh bacteria type things but multicellular life seems incredibly hard that step of you know capturing
mitochondria and then sort of using that as part of yourself you know when you've just eaten it would you say that's the
biggest the most uh like if if you had to choose one sort of uh
hitchhiker's got this galaxy one sentence summary of like oh those clever creatures did this that would be the
multilist i think that was probably the one that that's the biggest i mean there's a great book called the 10 grand great inventions of evolution by nick
lane and he speculates on 10 10 of these you know what could be great filters um
i think that's one i think the the advent of of intelligence and and conscious intelligence and in order you
know to us to be able to do science and things like that is huge as well i mean it's only evolved once as far as you
know uh in in earth history so that would be a later candidate but there's
certainly for the early candidates i think multicellular life forms is huge by the way what it's interesting to ask
you if you can hypothesize about what is the origin of intelligence is it
uh that we started cooking meat over fire
is it that we somehow figured out that we could be very powerful when we start collaborating so cooperation between
um our ancestors so that we can overthrow the alpha male
uh what is it richard i talked to richard randham who thinks we're all just beta males who figured out how to
collaborate to defeat the one the dictator the authoritarian alpha male
um that control the tribe um is there other explanation did was there um 2001
space out any type of monolith yeah that came down to earth well i i think um i think all of those things you suggest
for good candidates fire and and and cooking right so that's clearly important
you know energy efficiency yeah cooking our meat and then and then being able to to to be more efficient about eating it
and getting it consuming the energy um i think that's huge and then utilizing fire and tools i think you're right
about the the tribal cooperation aspects and probably language as part of that yes um because probably that's what
allowed us to outcompete neanderthals and and perhaps less cooperative species so um so that may be the case tool
making spears axes i think that let us i mean i think it's pretty clear now that
humans were responsible for a lot of the extinctions of megafauna um especially in in the americas when humans arrived
so uh you can imagine once you discover tool usage how powerful that would have been and how scary for animals so i
think all of those could have been explanations for it you know the interesting thing is that it's a bit
like general intelligence too is it's very costly to begin with to have a brain
and especially a general purpose brain rather than a special purpose one because the amount of energy our brains use i think it's like 20 of the body's
energy and it's it's massive and when you're thinking chest one of the funny things that that we used to say is as
much as a racing driver uses for a whole you know formula one race if just playing a game of you know serious high
level chess which you you know you wouldn't think just sitting there um because the brain's using so much uh
energy so in order for an animal an organism to justify that there has to be a huge payoff and the problem with with
half a brain or half you know intelligence saying iqs of you know
of like a monkey brain it's it's not clear you can justify that evolutionary until you get to the human
level brain and so but how do you how do you do that jump it's very difficult which is why i think it's only been done
once from the sort of specialized brains that you see in animals to this sort of general purpose chewing powerful brains
that humans have um and which allows us to invent the modern modern world um and
uh you know it takes a lot to to cross that barrier and i think we've seen the same with ai systems which is that uh
maybe until very recently it's always been easier to craft a specific solution to a problem like chess than it has been
to build a general learning system that could potentially do many things because initially uh that system will be way
worse than uh less efficient than the specialized system so one of the interesting
quirks of the human mind of this evolved system is that it appears to be
conscious this thing that we don't quite understand but it seems very
very special its ability to have a subjective experience that it feels like something
to eat a cookie the deliciousness of it or see a color and that kind of stuff do you think in order to solve intelligence
we also need to solve consciousness along the way do you think agi systems need to have consciousness in order to
be truly intelligent yeah we thought about this a lot actually and um i think that
my guess is that consciousness and intelligence are double dissociable so you can have one without the other both
ways and i think you can see that with consciousness in that i think some animals and pets if you have a pet dog
or something like that you can see some of the higher animals and dolphins things like that are uh have
self-awareness and uh very sociable um seem to dream um you know those kinds of
a lot of the traits one would regard as being kind of conscious and self-aware um and but yet they're not that smart
right uh so they're not that intelligent by by say iq standards or something like that yeah it's also possible that our
understanding of intelligence is flawed like putting an iq to it sure maybe the thing that a dog can do
is actually gone very far along the path of intelligence and we humans are just able to
play chess and maybe write poems right but if we go back to the idea of agi and general intelligence you know dogs are
very specialized right most animals are pretty specialized they can be amazing at what they do but they're like kind of elite sports sports people or something
right so they do one thing extremely well because their entire brain is is optimized they have somehow convinced
the entirety of the human population to feed them and service them so in some way they're controlling yes exactly well
we co-evolved to some crazy degree right uh including the the way the dogs you know even even wag their tails and
twitch their noses right we find we're finding inexorably cute yeah um but i think um you can also see intelligence
on the other side so systems like artificial systems that are amazingly smart at certain things like maybe
playing go and chess and other things but they don't feel at all in any shape or form conscious in the way that you
know you do to me or i do to you and um and i think actually
building ai is uh these intelligent constructs uh is one of the best ways to explore the
mystery of consciousness to break it down because um we're going to have devices that are
pretty smart at certain things or capable of certain things but potentially won't have any semblance of
self-awareness or other things and in fact i would advocate if there's a choice building systems in
the first place ai systems that are not conscious to begin with uh are just tools um until we understand them better
and the capabilities better so on that topic just not as the ceo of deep mind
just as a human being let me ask you about this one particular anecdotal evidence of the google engineer
who made a comment or believed that there's some aspect of a language model
the lambda language model that exhibited sentience so you said you believe there might be a
responsibility to build systems that are not essential and this experience of a particular engineer i think i'd love to
get your general opinion on this kind of thing but i think it will happen more and more and more which uh not when engineers but when
people out there that don't have an engineering background start interacting with increasingly intelligent systems
we anthropomorphize them they they start to have deep impactful
um interactions with us in a way that we miss them yeah when they're gone and
we sure feel like they're living entities self-aware entities and maybe even we project sentience onto
them so what what's your thought about this particular uh system was is uh
have you ever met a language model that's sentient no i no no what do you make of the case
of when you kind of feel that there's some elements of sentience to this system yeah so this is you know
an interesting question and uh uh obviously a very fundamental one so first thing to say is i think that
none of the systems we have today i i would say even have one iota of uh semblance of consciousness or sentience
that's my personal feeling interacting with them every day so i think that's way premature to be discussing what that
engineer talked about i appreciate i think at the moment it's more of a projection of the way our own minds work
which is to see uh uh uh sort of purpose and direction
in almost anything that we you know our brains are trained to interpret uh agency basically in things uh even the
an inanimate thing sometimes and of course with a a language system because language is so fundamental to
intelligence that's going to be easy for us to anthropomorphize that i mean back in the day even the first uh
you know the dumbest sort of template chatbots ever eliza and and and and the ilk of the original chatbots back in the
60s fooled some people under certain circumstances right they pretended to be a psychologist so just basically rabbit
back to you the same question you asked it back to you um and uh some people believe that so i
don't think we can this is why i think the turing test is a little bit flawed as a formal test because it depends on the sophistication of the of the judge
um whether or not they are qualified to make that distinction so
i think we should uh talk to you know the the top philosophers about this people like daniel dennett and uh david
chalmers and others who've obviously thought deeply about consciousness of course consciousness itself hasn't been
well there's no agreed definition if i was to you know uh speculate about that
uh you know i kind of the definite the working definition i like is it's the way information feels when you know it
gets processed i think maybe max tegmark came up with that i like that idea i don't know if it helps us get towards any more operational thing but but it's
it's it's i think it's a nice way of viewing it um i think we can obviously see from neuroscience certain
prerequisites that are required like self-awareness i think is necessary but not sufficient component this idea of a
self and other and set of coherent preferences that are coherent over time
you know these things are maybe memory um these things are probably needed for a sentient or conscious being um but but
the reason that the difficult thing i think for us when we get and i think this is a really interesting philosophical debate is when we get
closer to agi and and and you know and and much more powerful systems than we have today
um how are we going to make this judgment and one way which is the turing test is sort of a behavioral judgment is
is the system exhibiting all the behaviors um that a human sentient uh or
a sentient being would would would exhibit um is it answering the right questions is it saying the right things is it indistinguishable from a human um
and so on but i think there's a second thing that makes us as humans regard each other as
sentient right why do we why do we think this and i debated this with daniel dennett and i think there's a second reason that's often overlooked which is
that we're running on the same substrate right so if we're exhibiting the same behavior uh more or less as humans and
we're running on the same you know carbon-based biological substrate the squishy you know few pounds of of flesh
in our skulls then the most parsimonious i think explanation is that you're
feeling the same thing as i'm feeling right but we will never have that second part the substrate equivalence with a
machine right so we will have to only judge based on the behavior and i think the substrate equivalence is a critical part
of why we make assumptions that we're conscious and in fact even with with animals high-level animals why we think
they might be because they're exhibiting some of the behaviors we would expect from a sentient animal and we know they're made of the same things
biological neurons so we're gonna have to come up with explanations uh or models of the gap
between substrate differences between machines and humans did to get anywhere
beyond the behavioral but to me sort of the practical question is very interesting and very important when
you have millions perhaps billions of people believing that you have ascension ai believing what that google engineer
believed which i just see is an obvious very near-term future thing certainly on
the path to agi how does that change the world what's the responsibility of the ai
system to help those millions of people and also what's the ethical thing because
you can you can make a lot of people happy by creating a meaningful deep experience
with a system that's faking it before it makes it yeah and i i don't
is a are we the right or who is to say what's the right thing to do should ai
always be tools like why why why are we constraining ais to always be tools as
opposed to friends yeah i think well i mean these are you know you know fantastic
questions and and also critical ones and we've been thinking about this uh since
the start of d minor before that because we planned for success and you know how how you know you know however remote
that looked like back in 2010 and we've always had sort of these ethical considerations as fundamental at
deepmind um and my current thinking on the language models is and and large models is they're not ready we don't
understand them well enough yet um and you know in terms of analysis tools and and guard rails what they can and can't
do and so on to deploy them at scale because i think you know there are big still ethical questions like should an
ai system always announce that it is an ai system to begin with probably yes um
it what what do you do about answering those philosophical questions about the feelings uh people may have about ai
systems perhaps incorrectly attributed so i think there's a whole bunch of research that needs to be done first um
to responsibly before you know you can responsibly deploy these systems at scale that would be at least be my
current position over time i'm very confident we'll have those tools like interpretability
questions um and uh analysis questions uh and then
with the ethical quandary you know i think there it's important to
uh look beyond just science that's why i think philosophy social sciences even
theology other things like that come into it where um what you know arts and humanities what what does it mean to be
human and the spirit of being human and and to enhance that and and the human condition right and allow us to
experience things we could never experience before and improve the the overall human condition and humanity
overall you know get radical abundance solve many scientific problems solve disease so this is the era i think this
is the amazing era i think we're heading into if we do it right um but we've got to be careful we've already seen with
things like social media how dual use technologies can be misused by firstly
by by by bad you know p bad actors or naive actors or crazy actors right so
there's that set of just the common or garden misuse of existing dual use technology and then of course there's an
additional uh uh thing that has to be overcome with ai that eventually it may have its own agency so it could be uh uh
uh good or bad in in in of itself so i think these questions have to be approached very carefully um using the
scientific method i would say in terms of hypothesis generation careful control testing not live a b testing out in the
world because with powerful dual technologies like ai if something goes wrong it may cause you
know a lot of harm before you can fix it um it's not like a you know an imaging app or game app where you know that if
if something goes wrong it's relatively easy to fix and and the harm's relatively small so i think
it comes with you know the the the usual uh cliche of like with a lot of power
comes a lot of responsibility and i think that's the case here with things like ai given the the enormous
opportunity in front of us and i think we need a lot of voices uh and as many
inputs into things like the design of the systems and the values they should have and what goals should
they be put to um i think as wide a group of voices as possible beyond just the technologies is needed uh to input
into that and to have a say in that especially when it comes to deployment of these systems which is when the
rubber really hits the road it really affects the general person in the street rather than fundamental research and
that's why i say i think as a first step it would be better if we have the choice to build
these systems as tools to give and i'm not saying that it should never they should never go beyond tools because of
course the potential is there um for it to go way beyond just tools uh but um i
think that would be a good first step in order for us to you know allow us to carefully experiment understand what
these things can do so the leap between tool to sentient entity being is one
should take very careful yes let me ask a dark personal question so you're one of the most brilliant
people in the ag community also one of the most kind and uh if i may say sort of loved people
in the community that said uh creation of a super intelligent ai
system would be one of the most powerful things in the world tools or otherwise
and again as the old saying goes power corrupts and absolute power crops absolutely
you are likely to be one of the people
i would say probably the most likely person to be in the control of such a system
do you think about the corrupting nature of power when you talk about these kinds of systems that
um as all dictators and people have caused atrocities in the past always think they're doing good
but they don't do good because the powers polluted their mind about what is good and what is evil do you think about
this stuff or are we just focused on language modeling no i think about them all the time and you know i think
what are the defenses against that i think one thing is to remain very grounded and sort of humble uh no matter
what you do or achieve and i try to do that i might you know my best friends are still my set of friends from my
undergraduate cambridge days my family's you know and and friends are very important
um i've always i think trying to be a multi-disciplinary person it helps to keep you humble because no matter how
good you are at one topic someone will be better than you at that and it and always relearning a new topic again from
scratch is or new field is very humbling right so for me that's been biology over the last five years you know huge area
topic and and and it's been and i just love doing that but it helps to keep you grounded like it keeps you open-minded
and and then the other important thing is to have a really good amazing set of uh people around you at your company or
your organization who are also very ethical and grounded themselves and help to keep you that way
and then ultimately just to answer your question i hope we're going to be a big part of of birthing ai and that being
the greatest benefit to humanity of any tool or technology ever and and getting us into a world of radical abundance and
curing diseases and and and solving many of the big challenges we have in front of us and then ultimately you know help the
ultimate flourishing of humanity to travel the stars and find those aliens if they are there and if they're not there find out why they're not there
what what is going on here in the universe um this is all to come and and that's what i've always dreamed about um
but i don't think i think ai is too big an idea it's not going to be uh there'll be a certain set of pioneers who get
there first i hope we're in the vanguard so we can influence how that goes and i think it matters who builds who which which
cultures they come from and what values they have uh the builders of ai systems because i think even though the ai
system is going to learn for itself most of its knowledge there'll be a residue in the system of the culture and the
values of the creators of the system um and there's interesting questions to to discuss about that geopolitically you
know different cultures as we're in a more fragmented world than ever unfortunately i think in terms of global cooperation
we see that in things like climate where we can't seem to get our act together uh globally to cooperate on these pressing
matters i hope that will change over time perhaps you know if we get to an era of radical abundance we don't have
to be so competitive anymore maybe we can be more cooperative if resources aren't so scarce it's true
that in terms of power corrupting and leading to destructive things it seems that some of
the atrocities of the past happen when there's a significant constraint on resources i think that's
the first thing i don't think that's enough i think scarcity is one thing that's led to competition destruct you know sort of zero sum game thinking i
would like us to all be in a positive sum world and i think for that you have to remove scarcity i don't think that's enough unfortunately to get world peace
because there's also other corrupting things like wanting power over people and this kind of stuff which is not
necessarily satisfied by by just abundance but i think it will help um
and i think uh but i think ultimately ai is not going to be run by any one person or one organization i think it should
belong to the world belong to humanity um and i think maybe many there'll be many ways this will happen and
ultimately um everybody should have a say in that do you have advice
for uh young people in high school and college maybe um
if they're interested in ai or interested in having a big impact on the world what they should
do to have a career they can be proud of her to have a life they can be proud of i love giving talks to the next
generation what i say to them is actually two things i i think the most important things to learn about and to
find out about when you're when you're young is what are your true passions is first of all there's two things one is
find your true passions and i think you can do that by the way to do that is to explore as many things as possible when
you're young and you you have the time and you and you can take those risks um i would also encourage people to look at
the finding the connections between things in a unique way i think that's a really great way to find a passion second thing
i would say advise is know yourself so spend a lot of time
understanding how you work best like what are the optimal times to work what are the optimal ways that you study um
what are your how do you deal with pressure sort of test yourself in various scenarios and try and improve your
weaknesses but also find out what your unique skills and strengths are and then
hone those so then that's what will be your super value in the world later on and if you can then combine those two
things and find passions that you're genuinely excited about that intersect with what your unique strong skills are
then you're you know you're on to something incredible and and you know i think you can make a huge difference in the world so let me ask about know
yourself this is fun this is fun quick questions about day in the life the
perfect day the perfect productive day in the life of demise's house yeah maybe uh maybe these days you're um
there's a lot involved yeah it may be a slightly younger you could focus on a demonstration
project maybe um how early do you wake up are you night owl do you wake up early in the morning
what are some interesting habits uh how many dozens of cups of coffees do you drink a day what's the computer um
that you use uh what's the setup how many screens what kind of keyboard are we talking uh
emacs vim are we talking something more modern so it's a bunch of those questions so maybe uh day in the life
what what's the perfect day involved well these days it's quite different from say 10 20 years ago back 10 20
years ago it would have been you know a whole day of research individual research or
programming doing some experiment neuroscience computer science experiment reading lots of research papers uh and
then perhaps at night time you know um reading science fiction books or or uh
playing uh some games but lots of focus so like deep focused work on whether
it's uh programming or reading research paper yes yes so that would be a lot of debrief you know uh focused work these
days for the last sort of i guess you know five to ten years i've actually got quite a structure that works very well
for me now which is that um i'm a night complete night out always have been so i optimized for that so you know i get you
know i basically do a normal day's work get into work about 11 o'clock and sort of do work to about seven uh in the
office uh and i will arrange back-to-back meetings for the entire time of that and with as many me as many
people as possible so that's my collaboration management part of the day then i go home uh spend time with the
family and friends uh have dinner uh uh relax a little bit and then i start a
second day of work i call it my second day work around 10 pm 11 p.m and that's the time till about the small hours of
the morning four five in the morning where i will do my thinking and reading
a research writing research papers um sadly don't have time to code anymore
but it's it's not efficient to to do that uh these days uh given the amount of time i have um but that's when i do
you know maybe do the long kind of stretches of of thinking and planning and then probably you know using using
email or other things i would set i would fire off a lot of things to my team to deal with the next morning for
actually thinking about this overnight we should go for this project or arrange this meeting the next day when you're
thinking through a problem are you talking about a sheet of paper or the patent pen is there some independent structure yeah i like processes i still
like pencil and paper best for working out things but um these days it's just so efficient to read research papers
just on the screen i still often print them out actually i still prefer to mark out things and i find it goes into
the brain quick better and sticks in the brain better when you're you're still using physical pen and pencil and paper
so you take notes with the i have lots of nodes electronic ones and also um whole stacks of notebooks that
um that i use at home yeah on some of these most challenging next steps for example stuff
none of us know about that you're working on you're thinking there's some deep thinking required
there right like what what is the right problem what is the right approach because you're gonna have to invest a
huge amount of time for the whole team they're going to have to pursue this thing what's the right way to do it is
is rl going to work here or not yes um what's the right thing to try what's the right benchmark to use yeah we need to
construct a benchmark from scratch all those kinds of things yes so i think all those kind of things in the night time
phase but also much more um i find i've always found the quiet hours of the
morning um when everyone's asleep it's super quiet outside um i love that time
it's the golden hours like between like one and three in the morning um put some music on some inspiring music on and
then um think these deep thoughts so that's when i would read you know my philosophy books and uh spinoza's my you
know recent favorite can all these things i i i you know read about a great uh uh
a scientist of history how they did things how they thought things so that's when you do all your create that's when
i do all my creative thinking and it's good i think i think people recommend you know you do your your your sort of
creative thinking in one block and the way i organize the day that way i don't get interrupted because obviously no one
else is up uh at those times so i can i can go uh you know as i can sort of get
super deep and super into flow the other nice thing about doing it night time wise is if i'm really uh onto something
or i've i've got really deep into something i can choose to extend it and i'll go into six in the morning whatever
and then i'll just pay for it the next day yeah cause i'll be a bit tired and i won't be my best but that's fine i can
decide looking at my schedule the next day that and given where i'm at with this particular thought or creative idea
that i'm going to pay that cost the next day so so i think that's that's more flexible than morning people who do that
you know they get up at four in the morning they can also do those golden hours then but then their start of their schedule day starts at breakfast you
know 8 a.m whatever they have their first meeting and then it's hard you have to reschedule a day if you're in flow yeah that's going to be i don't
have to see that special threat of thoughts that the you're too passionate about you that
this is where some of the greatest ideas could potentially come is when you just lose yourself late into yeah
and for the meetings i mean you're loading in really hard problems in a very short amount of time so you have to
do some kind of first principles thinking here it's like what's the problem what's the state of things what's the right next step yes you have
to get really good at context switching which is one of the hardest things because especially as we do so many
things if you include all the scientific things we do scientific fields we're working in these are entire you know
complex fields in themselves and you you have to sort of keep up to abreast of that but i enjoy it i've always been uh
a sort of generalist in a way and that's actually what happened with my games career after chess i i i one of the
reasons i stopped playing chess was that i got into computers but also i started realizing there were many other great games out there to play too so
i've always been that way inclined multidisciplinary and there's too many interesting things in in the world to spend all your time just on one thing
so you mentioned spinoza gotta ask the big ridiculously big question about life
what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing uh why are we humans here you've already
mentioned that perhaps the universe created us is that why you think we're here
to understand how the universe yeah i think my answer to that would be and at least the the life i'm living is to gain
and uh to gain and understand the knowledge you know to gain knowledge and understand the universe that's what i
think uh i can't see any higher purpose than that if you think back to the classical greeks you know the virtue of
gaining knowledge it's uh i think it's that it's one of the few true virtues is to understand um the world around us and
the context and humanity better and um and i think if you do that you become more compassionate and more
understanding yourself and and more tolerant and all these i think all these other things may flow from that and to
me you know understanding the nature of reality that is the biggest question what is going on here is sometimes the
colloquial way i say what is really going on here uh it's so mysterious i feel like we're
in some huge puzzle and and it's but the world is also seems to be the universe
seems to be structured in a way you know why is it structured in a way that science is even possible that you know
methods the scientific method works things are repeatable um it feels like it's almost structured
in a way to be conducive to gaining knowledge so i feel like and you know why should computers be even possible
isn't that amazing that uh computational electronic devices can can can can be
possible and they're made of sand our most you know common element that we have you know silicon that on the on the
earth's crust they could be made of diamond or something then we would have only had one computer yeah right so it's
a lot of things are kind of slightly suspicious to me it sure as heck sounds this puzzle sure sounds like something
we talked about earlier what it takes to to design a game that's really fun to play for prolonged
periods of time and it does seem like this puzzle like you mentioned the more you learn about
it the more you realize how little you know so it humbles you but excites you by the
possibility of learning more it's one heck of a one heck of a puzzle we got going on here um so like i mentioned of
all the people in the world you're very likely to be the one who creates the agi
system um that achieves human level intelligence and goes beyond it so if
you got a chance and very well you could be the person that goes into the room with the system and have a conversation
maybe you only get to ask one question if you do what question would you ask her
i would probably ask um what is the true nature of reality i think that's the question i don't know
if i'd understand the answer because maybe it would be 42 or something like that but um that's the question i would
ask and then there'll be a deep sigh from the systems like all right how do i
explain to the excuse me exactly all right let me i don't have time to explain uh maybe i'll draw you a
picture that it is i mean how do you even begin um
to answer that question well i think it would um what would you what would you think the answer could
possibly look like i think it could it could start looking like uh
uh more fundamental explanations of physics would be the beginning you know more careful specification of that
taking you walking us through by the hand as to what one would do to maybe prove those things out maybe giving you
glimpses of what things you totally missed in the physics of today exactly just here here's glimpses of no
like there's a much uh a much more elaborate world or a much simpler world or something
a much deeper maybe simpler explanation yes of things right than the standard model of physics which we know doesn't
work but we still keep adding to so um and and that's how i think the beginning
of an explanation would look and it would start encompassing many of the mysteries that we have wondered about for thousands of years like you know
consciousness uh life and gravity all of these things yeah giving us a glimpses of
explanations for those things yeah well um damas dear one of the special
human beings in this giant puzzle of ours and it's a huge honor that you would take a pause from the bigger
puzzle to solve this small puzzle of a conversation with me today it's truly an honor and a pleasure thank you thank you
i really enjoyed it thanks lex thanks for listening to this conversation with demas establish to
support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words
from edskar dykstra computer science is no more about computers
than astronomy is about telescopes thank you for listening and hope to see
you next time
